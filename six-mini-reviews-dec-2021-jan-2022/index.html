Give them a shot if they sound interesting.<p>The links lead to the book page on goodreads, from where I've also copied a portion of the blurbs for this post.</p><span id=continue-reading></span><hr><h2 id=inda-by-sherwood-smith><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222837.Inda>Inda</a> by <strong>Sherwood Smith</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Indevan Algara-Vayir was born the second son of a powerful prince, destined to stay at home and defend his family's castle. But when war threatens, Inda is sent to the Royal Academy where he learns the art of war and finds that danger and intrigue don't only come from outside the kingdom.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>This was a compelling read, especially in the second half as I got used to the setting, writing, characters, politics, etc.<p>I wanted to jump to the second book immediately after that ending, but managed to stop myself from getting hurt further.<p>Highly recommended for fans of epic fantasy who favor the dark/grimdark flavor.<hr><h2 id=a-body-on-fitzgerald-s-bluff-by-anna-celeste-burke><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41566728-a-body-on-fitzgerald-s-bluff>A Body on Fitzgeraldâ€™s Bluff</a> by <strong>Anna Celeste Burke</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Miriam Websterâ€™s a woman with a few secretsâ€”can she keep them after she and her spirited Dalmatian, Domino, find a body on Fitzgeraldâ€™s Bluff?</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>Well, that was a breezy read. Writing was easy to follow and I liked that it was a cozy setting with baked goods (and recipes at the end of the book!) instead of gritty scenes typical of murder mysteries.<hr><h2 id=the-soul-s-aspect-by-mark-holloway><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59494616-the-soul-s-aspect>The Soul's Aspect</a> by <strong>Mark Holloway</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Kehlem, the sickly son of a widowed physician, has devoted his life to learning his fatherâ€™s craft. Wanting to finally step out of his fatherâ€™s shadow, he embarks on a project of his own, seeking out the help of Themia, the town's newly arrived Alchemist and a rare wielder of magic.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>The last quarter of the book was just too dark for me. If I had known about that I wouldn't have read this. But if you like grimdark fantasy, you might enjoy reading this.<p>The writing was easy to understand and pacing was great right from the start. The worldbuilding around the magic academy towers was nice.<hr><h2 id=circle-of-magic><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55765998-circle-of-magic>Circle of Magic</a></h2><p><strong>Review</strong><p>I read this for the novelty factor - a collection of <=100 word short stories. Some stories were good, especially ones that got a chuckle out of me. I'd have liked it better if so many stories didn't have the same prompt.<hr><h2 id=the-long-way-to-a-small-angry-planet-by-becky-chambers><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22733729-the-long-way-to-a-small-angry-planet>The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet</a> by <strong>Becky Chambers</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Follow a motley crew on an exciting journey through space-and one adventurous young explorer who discovers the meaning of family in the far reaches of the universe-in this light-hearted debut space opera from a rising sci-fi star.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>This was a long awaited revisit, 5 years since I read it first. Enjoyed it very much this time around as well. Every crew member was fleshed out memorably, and the side characters were well written too. Especially liked the various cultures and their quirks.<hr><h2 id=miss-percy-s-pocket-guide-to-the-care-and-feeding-of-british-dragons-by-quenby-olson><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55040182-miss-percy-s-pocket-guide-to-the-care-and-feeding-of-british-dragons>Miss Percy's Pocket Guide to the Care and Feeding of British Dragons</a> by <strong>Quenby Olson</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Miss Mildred Percy is a spinster. She does not dance, she has long stopped dreaming, and she certainly does not have adventures. That is, until her great uncle has the audacity to leave her an inheritance, one that includes a dragonâ€™s egg.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>Enjoyed reading this charming slice-of-life novel about discovering and taking care of a dragon. It was nice to see older protagonist as well. Characters were all well written. Writing was easy to follow and I'd say the pacing was steady all the way through.<p>Interested to see how the sequel(s) would go.</div><div class=post-footer><div class=post-tags><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/2021/>#2021</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/2022/>#2022</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/mini-reviews/>#mini-reviews</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/fantasy/>#fantasy</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/mystery/>#mystery</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/science-fiction/>#science-fiction</a></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><div class=post-nav><p><a class=previous href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tales-from-ruun/>â€¹ Tales from Ruun: fantasy short story collection</a><br><p><a class=next href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/edict-of-honor/>Edict of Honor: fantastic sequel â€º</a><br></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><p>ðŸ“° Use <a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/rss.xml>this link</a> for the RSS feed. <br> âœ… Follow me on <a href=https://twitter.com/learn_byexample>Twitter</a>, <a href=https://github.com/learnbyexample>GitHub</a> and <a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/learnbyexample42>Youtube</a> for interesting tech nuggets. <br> ðŸ“§ Subscribe to <a href=https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/learnbyexample-weekly>learnbyexample weekly</a> for programming resources, tips, tools, free ebooks and more (free newsletter, delivered every Friday).<hr color=#e6e6e6></div></article></div></main></div><script src=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/even.js></script>
