Give them a shot if they sound interesting.<p>The links lead to the book page on goodreads, from where I've also copied a portion of the blurbs for this post.</p><span id=continue-reading></span><hr><h2 id=dragon-forged-by-nerine-dorman><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64406927-dragon-forged>Dragon Forged</a> by <strong>Nerine Dorman</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>All Orna Ironheart wants is to take over her father’s forge when he retires, but things aren’t so simple for young dwarven women in the town of Stonehaven. Yet when a dragon is sighted, and Orna’s da embarks on a foolhardy quest to kill the beast and capture its treasure, Orna just knows this is going to spell disaster. Despite the odds stacked against them, Orna and her friend Dani set out on the menfolks’ tracks, and their journey across a perilous marsh, through a gloomy forest, and up a precipitous mountain has them realise that even two dwarven girls might just be their people’s only hope when a dragon’s fury is unleashed.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>This was a well written novella about two dwarf friends going on an adventure to save their village from a dragon. I especially liked how the author wove events from their daily lives into the plot. I would've enjoyed a longer novel, especially to see how they continued their crafts, may be another adventure or two, visiting places of interest, etc.<hr><h2 id=the-rise-of-kyoshi-by-f-c-yee><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41104164-the-rise-of-kyoshi>The Rise of Kyoshi</a> by <strong>F.C. Yee</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>The Rise of Kyoshi delves into the story of Kyoshi, the Earth Kingdom–born Avatar. The longest-living Avatar in this beloved world’s history, Kyoshi established the brave and respected Kyoshi Warriors, but also founded the secretive Dai Li, which led to the corruption, decline, and fall of her own nation. The first of two novels based on Kyoshi, The Rise of Kyoshi maps her journey from a girl of humble origins to the merciless pursuer of justice who is still feared and admired centuries after she became the Avatar.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>Unfortunately, this was too dark for me. The start was very promising but took a turn for the worse with betrayals. I'd have stopped there, but there was still a tiny hope and the plot was intriguing. And I found myself enjoying the events that followed until the climax — which was well executed, but again wasn't for me.<hr><h2 id=the-bookbinder-s-daughter-by-jane-glatt><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34085453-the-bookbinder-s-daughter>The Bookbinder's Daughter</a> by <strong>Jane Glatt</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Faelin Keetley has kept secrets all her life — she can read, a skill that none but the Conjurers are allowed. And she has taken over bookbinding jobs from her father, when women on the Bridge are forbidden professions. Her father’s death leaves Faelin with even more dangerous secrets. His last words were a spell, and all his life he’s been hiding a room full of hundreds of spellbooks.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>I had previously enjoyed reading "Unguilded" by this author, so I was hoping something similar. Unfortunately, this turned out to be too dark for me — with too many deaths and cruelty of the conjurers becoming unbearable to read. That said, the book was well written — the plot and secrets of the magic would keep you hooked.<hr><h2 id=the-lives-of-christopher-chant-by-diana-wynne-jones><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/519933.The_Lives_of_Christopher_Chant>The Lives of Christopher Chant</a> by <strong>Diana Wynne Jones</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>His father and uncles are enchanters, his mother a powerful sorceress, yet nothing seems magical about Christopher Chant except his dreams. Night after night, he climbs through the formless Place Between and visits marvelous lands he calls the Almost Anywheres. Then Christopher discovers that he can bring real, solid things back from his dreams. Others begin to recognize the extent of his powers, and they issue an order that turns Christopher's life upside down: Go to Chrestomanci Castle to train to be the controller of all the world's magic.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>Another charming entry in the Chrestomanci series. Things seem weird at first and then they start to make sense. I especially liked the idea of being able to bring back things from other worlds. The way Chant finally gets how he should work with his power at the end was great.<hr><h2 id=small-miracles-by-olivia-atwater><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123245772-small-miracles>Small Miracles</a> by <strong>Olivia Atwater</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Gadriel, the fallen angel of petty temptations, has a bit of a gambling debt. Fortunately, her angelic bookie is happy to let her pay off her debts by doing what she does best: All Gadriel has to do is tempt miserably sinless mortal Holly Harker to do a few nice things for herself.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>I needed a lighthearted feel-good book and by now I know I can count on Atwater to deliver. This was a delightful read, filled with small moments that nonetheless have a big impact on the characters.<p>Gadriel, a fallen angel, is given the task of tempting Holly (a highly virtuous character) just a little bit. One thing leads to another and suddenly there are many more characters connected to this seemingly simple saga and Gadriel has to dig deep to deliver. And along the way, perhaps Gadriel needed uplifting as much as the other characters ;)<p>Also, the footnotes were charming too!</div><div class=post-footer><div class=post-tags><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/2023/>#2023</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/mini-reviews/>#mini-reviews</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/fantasy/>#fantasy</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/epic/>#epic</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/dark/>#dark</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/whimsical/>#whimsical</a></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><div class=post-nav><p><a class=previous href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/eight-progression-fantasy-mini-reviews/>‹ Mini reviews for eight progression fantasy books</a><br><p><a class=next href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/a-coup-of-tea/>A Coup of Tea: a delightful read ›</a><br></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><p>📰 Use <a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/rss.xml>this link</a> for the RSS feed. <br> ✅ Follow me on <a href=https://twitter.com/learn_byexample>Twitter</a>, <a href=https://github.com/learnbyexample>GitHub</a> and <a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/learnbyexample42>Youtube</a> for interesting tech nuggets. <br> 📧 Subscribe to <a href=https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/learnbyexample-weekly>learnbyexample weekly</a> for programming resources, tips, tools, free ebooks and more (free newsletter, delivered every Friday).<hr color=#e6e6e6></div></article></div></main></div><script src=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/even.js></script>
