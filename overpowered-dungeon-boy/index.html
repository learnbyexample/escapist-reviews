Book one of a short, two-book mini-series.<p>A monster dungeon is all Thomas has ever known. After all, he was born there. Now, at age fourteen, heâ€™s been solo-clearing all one hundred floors of the dungeon for years. The last of his family and friends are about to die off as an eternal void beast tirelessly pursues them. Will they ever escape? Thomasâ€™s strength is unparalleled, but what does it matter when youâ€™re trapped in an endlessly repeating prison? He would love nothing more than to see the sky for the very first time and find a safe place to settle down. Fate has much more in mind, but her best efforts only go so far when it comes to the overpowered dungeon boy. Meanwhile, Nell Windborn lives in a tiny village, clustered on the side of the hundred-league-tall cliff. When the villagers run out of water, they attempt a daring plan, only for their best-laid plans to go awry. Nell canâ€™t save them alone, but maybe she wonâ€™t have to as strange new visitors drop from the sky.</blockquote><h2 id=review><p style="color: #7e0b5f">Review</h2><p>With a book title like that, I went in hoping for a fun, quick read and that's what I got. Although, the initial few chapters didn't really draw me in. The odd humor really seemed out of place, but as I kept reading, it did make a bit of sense. What really got me hooked was the introduction of Gina (pet companion, who was overpowered too :D), Nell (and her precarious village) and a few more side characters as the story progressed. The main character Thomas took me a while to appreciate.<p>The sequel was good too. New side characters were a welcome addition. Plenty of action, some nice surprises and good pacing kept me interested. Dirty jokes were a bit overdone in my opinion.<p>Overall, I'd recommend this short series for those looking for a light, fun read and don't mind overpowered characters. The revelations at the end felt like follow-up/prequel series were planned as well.<p><em>My rating:</em> ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸâ˜†<h3 id=what-others-are-saying><p style="color: #a0494c">What others are saying</h3><p>From <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5752560327>Luke's review on goodreads</a>:<blockquote><p>This simplistic and predictable OP MC tale is saved by its humor and pacing and was surprisingly fun to read relative to other soft LitRPG. Definitely recommended if the blurb sounds like something you're interested in.</blockquote><p>From <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5751942292>Wendy's review on goodreads</a>:<blockquote><p>There are more than a few clunky bits in the book, but the inventive (often delightfully weird) choices sprinkled throughout add a lot of charm. I liked how the OP character was exuberant and honorableâ€”my kind of power fantasy.</blockquote></div><div class=post-footer><div class=post-tags><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/progression/>#progression</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/fantasy/>#fantasy</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/self-published/>#self-published</a></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><div class=post-nav><p><a class=next href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/card-mage/>Card Mage: Slumdog Deckbuilder, well written dark fantasy â€º</a><br></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><p>ðŸ“° Use <a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/rss.xml>this link</a> for the RSS feed. <br> âœ… Follow me on <a href=https://twitter.com/learn_byexample>Twitter</a>, <a href=https://github.com/learnbyexample>GitHub</a> and <a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/learnbyexample42>Youtube</a> for interesting tech nuggets. <br> ðŸ“§ Subscribe to <a href=https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/learnbyexample-weekly>learnbyexample weekly</a> for programming resources, tips, tools, free ebooks and more (free newsletter, delivered every Friday).<hr color=#e6e6e6></div></article></div></main></div><script src=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/even.js></script>
