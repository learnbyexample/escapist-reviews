This is a standalone novel set in the <em>Stories from The Three Kingdoms</em> series.</p><span id=continue-reading></span><p align=center><img alt="Old Wizards Home book cover" src=/escapist-reviews/images/book_covers/old_wizards_home.jpg><h2 id=blurb><p style="color: #7e0b5f">Blurb</h2><blockquote><p>Rodius Drach - the most evil and villainous wizard to have ever lived - has languished in the Old Wizards Home for ten thousand years. But his arch nemesis, the white wizard Delavar Godson is planning an escape. Will Rodius team up with his sworn rival? Will he once again summon his black army to torment the land and bring forth a dark age?<p>Genevieve Drach, Rodius's distant relative, is on a quest to educate the world about politics and society, if only she could find a printing press and someone who would listen to what she has to say. She knows the truth of the world, about the control and propaganda spread by those in power. A bit of coin in her pocket would go a long way on her journey, and there's a job opening at the Old Wizards Home.</blockquote><h2 id=review><p style="color: #7e0b5f">Review</h2><p>I had previously read <em>You Can't Prevent Prophecy</em> (same setting, different characters). This was similar â€” short novel, mostly lighthearted in tone, good pacing, twists and sprinkled with humor.<p>As mentioned in the blurb, Rodius is a villainous wizard and Genevieve wants to make the world better. Rodius was powerful, thanks to his deal with the dark lord. He was on the way to rule the world before being captured and imprisoned for ten thousand years. Genevieve came across as a naive idealist. As you can probably guess, circumstances lead to these two meeting, discovering they are <em>distantly</em> related and then working together to achieve their own goals. Though it was hard for me to like either of these two main characters, I'd say they were well written.<p>Overall, I'd recommend this series for those looking for a change from the usual darker tone of epic fantasy books.<p><em>My rating:</em> ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸâ˜†<h3 id=what-others-are-saying><p style="color: #a0494c">What others are saying</h3><p>From <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5084185473>Jamedi's review on goodreads</a>:<blockquote><p>The novel is pretty fun and fast-paced, not slowing a single moment, and making great use of its strengths. The plot is a little bit based on certain fantasy clichÃ©s, but gives its own twists and surprises, making you recognize certain classic themes of the genre, to shortly after start twisting it, just changing it for the sake of fun, and that's greatly why it remembers me so much to Discworld (one of my favourite fantasy sagas). I found myself laughing loud so many times, almost in each chapter, because there was always a way to make it original despite taking the oldest fantasy topics, and even the ending is surprising, something I didn't expect.</blockquote><h2 id=bingo><p style="color: #7e0b5f">Bingo</h2><p><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ttrev1/official_rfantasy_2022_book_bingo_challenge/>/r/Fantasy/ 2022 bingo categories</a>:<ul><li>Anti-Hero<li>Author Uses Initials<li>Published in 2022<li>Self-Published OR Indie Publisher (HM)<li>No Ifs, Ands, or Buts (HM)</ul></div><div class=post-footer><div class=post-tags><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/fantasy/>#fantasy</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/self-published/>#self-published</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/humor/>#humor</a></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><div class=post-nav><p><a class=next href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/miss-percys-travel-guide-to-welsh-moors-and-feral-dragons/>Miss Percy's Travel Guide to Welsh Moors and Feral Dragons: cozy historical fantasy â€º</a><br></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><p>ðŸ“° Use <a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/rss.xml>this link</a> for the RSS feed. <br> âœ… Follow me on <a href=https://twitter.com/learn_byexample>Twitter</a>, <a href=https://github.com/learnbyexample>GitHub</a> and <a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/learnbyexample42>Youtube</a> for interesting tech nuggets. <br> ðŸ“§ Subscribe to <a href=https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/learnbyexample-weekly>learnbyexample weekly</a> for programming resources, tips, tools, free ebooks and more (free newsletter, delivered every Friday).<hr color=#e6e6e6></div></article></div></main></div><script src=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/even.js></script>
