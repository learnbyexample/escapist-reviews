Since binge reading the first 5 Cradle books in 2018, I've been reading subsequent books on the day of release (sometimes planning ahead to keep my schedule free). My first reaction for <em>Bloodline</em>, despite finishing the book much faster than usual, was a bit of disappointment.<p>Fan reactions and theories have helped me better understand the events that took place in <em>Bloodline</em>. But there's still a bit of lingering disappointment. In an ideal world, instead of delaying, Will would've taken his break when he needed and however long it took to recover. I feel this book suffered a bit because of the delay, but I'm happy that we got a book to read at all.<p>With so much happening in a short amount of time and the breakneck pacing, a re-read (and future books) seems necessary to fully appreciate the events of <em>Bloodline</em>. There is a self-contained main plot, but this book is very much a transitional one too. The end game has started and we got plenty of exciting hints. This was also the darkest book of the series so far.<p>One of the fan theories proposed was that the next book would be similar to <em>Ghostwater</em> in setting/plot and I hope that turns out to be true.<p><em>My rating:</em> ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ<h3 id=what-others-are-saying>What others are saying</h3><p>Selected lines from <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/mlkszg/quick_review_with_spoilers_i_binged_bloodline/>Karthak_Maz_Urzak's spoiler review on /r/Fantasy</a>:<blockquote><p>Gawd damn did it hold me in a tight grip.<p>Were there headscratchers? Some, but minor in my opinion.<p>This book was...bleaker than the rest. It's not quite "If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention" territory, but Mr. Wight slapped the reader in the face in this book more times than in the rest of the series combined.<p>To quote the poets: this was some good shit.</blockquote><p>From <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3928771850>Benny Hinrichs's review on goodreads</a>:<details><summary>Click to view spoiler</summary>Definitely a good book. Definitely not the best Cradle book. Some scenes I wish had been longer, and some I wish had been shorter. It felt like the reunion with Orthos didn't get enough time, and we spent a little too much time convincing the clans. We could have had one more scene with the Wei clan elders. The cosmic scenes, e.g. where a planet gets cut in half, are sort of too big to really appreciate. They don't feel much grander than fighting the dreadgod. I think because they aren't built up in the same way, so the sense of scale is lost. A lot of good scenes in this book, just wanted a few changes to make it flow better and hit all the satisfaction points.</details><h2 id=bingo>Bingo</h2><p><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/mhz2tt/official_rfantasy_2021_book_bingo_challenge/>/r/Fantasy/ 2021 bingo categories</a>:<ul><li>Set in Asia<li>Found Family<li>Published in 2021<li>Self-Published</ul></div><div class=post-footer><div class=post-tags><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/progression/>#progression</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/fantasy/>#fantasy</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/self-published/>#self-published</a></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><div class=post-nav><p><a class=previous href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/battle-mage/>â€¹ Battle Mage: standalone epic fantasy</a><br><p><a class=next href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/siege-of-skyhold/>The Siege of Skyhold: clash of titans amidst politicking â€º</a><br></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><p>ðŸ“° Use <a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/rss.xml>this link</a> for the RSS feed. <br> âœ… Follow me on <a href=https://twitter.com/learn_byexample>Twitter</a>, <a href=https://github.com/learnbyexample>GitHub</a> and <a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/learnbyexample42>Youtube</a> for interesting tech nuggets. <br> ðŸ“§ Subscribe to <a href=https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/learnbyexample-weekly>learnbyexample weekly</a> for programming resources, tips, tools, free ebooks and more (free newsletter, delivered every Friday).<hr color=#e6e6e6></div></article></div></main></div><script src=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/even.js></script>
