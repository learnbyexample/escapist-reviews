But from where he stands now, living up to the Vana name feels impossible.<p>When his best friend Alani, an initiate at the local Church, is sent on a pilgrimage to find her path in life and the god she will follow, Balt sees the perfect opportunity to launch his career by escorting her across the archipelago and its purple seas. The islands are filled with monsters to imprint and Summoners to battle, with every victory bringing him one step closer to his dream.<p>It will take more than just his family name to reach the same heights as his grandmother, but Balt won't stop until he does.</blockquote><h2 id=review><p style="color: #7e0b5f">Review</h2><p><strong>On Lavender Tides</strong><p>I went in expecting to enjoy a slice-of-life story set in a world with progression fantasy magic system and I got exactly that. Especially loved all the food scenes. The problem is I'll be starting the second one soon and then I'll have wait for the rest of the series.<p>I'm not familiar with Pokemon lore, so not sure if that would've enhanced my experience. I did enjoy the concept of saving a magical copy of fantastic beasts as the base for Summoners. Then they have to train to get better and progress if they have to copy more powerful creatures. Add artificial boosts to the magic and you have a versatile mix of powers to be explored. There are also a few illustrated entries about such creatures at the end of the book.<p>Coming to the characters, Balt and Alani reminded me a bit of the dynamic duo from "Spit and Song" (in a good way). Both are just turned adults and this book has them going on a journey that brings out their character and paves the way for growth. Some of the side characters were good but some were really irritating (had to skim a few scenes).<p>Although the stakes were low in this book, there's also a buildup that's probably going to explore a major past event and resolve it by the end of the series.<p><strong>A Fracture in the Qwisdeep</strong><p>This book took place in a new island and I really liked the combination of exploring the Jekua conservation area punctuated with action scenes.<p>Balt and Alani continued to discover a few things about themselves and there were a few inevitable tense moments. I wish it hadn't led to the misunderstanding at the end, but it does gives room for becoming better in the coming novels.<p>It was good to see more of Niona in this book and relieved to not have to meet Balt's cousin. Speaking of side characters, the twins from the tour group were very irritating at the start but grew to be more likeable. Many of the sub plots in this book were resolved but left room for continuation. Will be interesting to see if they come up later on. The overarching plot also got interesting with the weird tech being used by the group attacking the shrines.<p>And, a pleasant surprise: the third book released today!! Not good news for my work though :D<p><strong>Makanuele Rumble</strong><p>I'd say the third-book was the best book in the series so far. The Jekua tournament fights took centre stage, but slice-of-life stuff continued to be a significant presence (reminded me of "Super Powereds"). Having POV chapters from Niona was a welcome surprise. And some more side characters were introduced in this book. Balt's cousin made a return and I must admit that I didn't expect the twists.<p>The overarching plot also moved significantly and I think things are shaping for plenty of twists on that front. I wonder if Alani's arc is leading towards summoning the powers being worshipped!<p>John Bierce's <em>in</em>famous sandwiches made an appearance and his Jekua team was gross too :D I'm sure there were more such author cameos.<p><em>My rating:</em> ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸâ˜†<h3 id=what-others-are-saying><p style="color: #a0494c">What others are saying</h3><p>From <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4814190715>The Wulver's Library's review on goodreads</a>:<blockquote><p>On Lavender Tides is the nostalgic adventure novel by Travis Riddle that just screams PokÃ©mon-esque adventure that is both dynamic and entertaining.</blockquote><p>From <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4988517619>sakinareads's review on goodreads</a>:<blockquote><p>I appreciated how despite the coziness of the book there was still a good amount of tension in the second half which kept the plot gripping. The world building is really brilliant also and the descriptive writing makes it very immersive. You can tell how much thought the author put into the world and the different Jekua animals.</blockquote><h2 id=bingo><p style="color: #7e0b5f">Bingo</h2><p><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ttrev1/official_rfantasy_2022_book_bingo_challenge/>/r/Fantasy/ 2022 bingo categories</a>:<ul><li>Weird Ecology (HM)<li>Published in 2022 <em>(first two books)</em><li>Urban Fantasy (HM)<li>Self-Published OR Indie Publisher (HM for last two books)<li>No Ifs, Ands, or Buts (HM for first book, third one is normal mode)<li>Family Matters</ul></div><div class=post-footer><div class=post-tags><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/progression/>#progression</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/fantasy/>#fantasy</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/self-published/>#self-published</a></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><div class=post-nav><p><a class=previous href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/the-rascor-plains/>â€¹ The Rascor Plains: great worldbuilding and plenty of twists</a><br><p><a class=next href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/crafting-magics/>Crafting Magics: time-loop with a twist â€º</a><br></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><p>ðŸ“° Use <a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/rss.xml>this link</a> for the RSS feed. <br> âœ… Follow me on <a href=https://twitter.com/learn_byexample>Twitter</a>, <a href=https://github.com/learnbyexample>GitHub</a> and <a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/learnbyexample42>Youtube</a> for interesting tech nuggets. <br> ðŸ“§ Subscribe to <a href=https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/learnbyexample-weekly>learnbyexample weekly</a> for programming resources, tips, tools, free ebooks and more (free newsletter, delivered every Friday).<hr color=#e6e6e6></div></article></div></main></div><script src=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/even.js></script>
