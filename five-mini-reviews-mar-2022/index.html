Give them a shot if they sound interesting.<p>The links lead to the book page on goodreads, from where I've also copied a portion of the blurbs for this post.</p><span id=continue-reading></span><hr><h2 id=the-luckless-by-a-m-sohma><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35653858-the-luckless>The Luckless</a> by <strong>A.M. Sohma</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>When Chronicles of Retha experiences a software malfunction, Kitâ€”a disenchanted veteran playerâ€”is stuck in the game without a way to log off. Even worse, sheâ€™s trapped playing as the most defective character possible, an elf dancer that was meant to be a prank.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>I've read a few litrpg before, but I prefer progression settings without it being a game. I've read "Heart of Ice" before, so I was willing to give this series a try.<p>It was a fun read, thanks to the premise. I still didn't care for the real-world connection, but I enjoyed the in-game events. No stat sheets was a plus.<p>Characters and banter made this a breeze to read. Looking forward to the sequels.<hr><h2 id=the-desperate-quest-by-a-m-sohma><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36214225-the-desperate-quest>The Desperate Quest</a> by <strong>A.M. Sohma</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Kit and her party of misfit players have managed to collect two of the four seals that are required to face Malignusâ€”Rethaâ€™s ultimate villain whose defeat may be the only way out of the game. Unfortunately for Kitâ€”who is stuck playing as a defective elf dancerâ€”the quest only grows more difficult.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>Having enjoyed the first book, I had expectations for the sequel. Overall I'd say it was indeed a good follow up. Part of it was the addition of a new side character and longer scene with Miles (who's isn't really a part of the team).<p>Around midway, I had a hunch about the climax and it somewhat did turn out that way. The ending nicely sets up the next part.<hr><h2 id=air-awakens-by-elise-kova><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23127048-air-awakens>Air Awakens</a> by <strong>Elise Kova</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Vhalla has always been taught to fear the Tower of Sorcerers, a mysterious magic society, and has been happy in her quiet world of books. But after she unknowingly saves the life of one of the most powerful sorcerers of them allâ€”the Crown Prince Aldrikâ€”she finds herself enticed into his world.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>I found this a fast paced read, events kept me engaged to find out what happened next and as a result I finished the book in less than a day.<p>I liked the starting premise and the main characters (they grew on me as the plot progressed). I wasn't a fan of Vhalla getting injured all the time though and especially the events at the end left a bad taste.<hr><h2 id=coffee-milk-spider-silk-by-coyote-j-m-edwards><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59560842-coffee-milk-spider-silk>Coffee, Milk & Spider Silk</a> by <strong>Coyote J.M. Edwards</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>What should a battle-worn 11-foot tall drider do when she's retiring from the Ember Guard and looking for a big change? Open a cafe, of course! Unfortunately, Gwen's skills are highly specialized -- she can contain a magical anomaly to protect the innocent without blinking, but taking inventory and tracking profits makes her sweat bullets. Itâ€™s not long before she wonders if patrolling the streets of Embervein wasnâ€™t a safer bet.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>Enjoyed this nice little novella about retiring from guard work and opening a cafe. I especially liked the characters and the setting (a special region for monster folks, has internet, social media, start up culture, etc).<hr><h2 id=you-can-t-prevent-prophecy-by-d-g-redd><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59545964-you-can-t-prevent-prophecy>You Can't Prevent Prophecy</a> by <strong>D.G. Redd</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>An arrogant human warrior who thinks he's the Chosen One. A halfling who thinks she's a master thief, and wants to put big people in their place. A dwarven cleric desperately trying to get into heaven. All of them want the Eye of Aera, a magical artefact spoken of in ancient prophecies. But prophecies are malleable things, that can be bent to suit the needs of those with the knowledge and power to do so.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>This was a mix of satire about chosen one stories while telling a chosen one story. Shorter than usual epic fantasy novels, it was a fast paced read. The core team characters all had some weird quirks when they were first introduced and grew to be more likeable by the end of the book.<p>Some twists were nice. Overall, I'd recommend this book for those looking for a change from the usual darker tone of epic fantasy books.</div><div class=post-footer><div class=post-tags><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/2022/>#2022</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/mini-reviews/>#mini-reviews</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/fantasy/>#fantasy</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/slice-of-life/>#slice-of-life</a></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><div class=post-nav><p><a class=previous href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/the-enchanter/>â€¹ The Enchanter: engaging magical academy tale</a><br><p><a class=next href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/legends-lattes/>Legends & Lattes: slice-of-life with a dollop of romantic froth â€º</a><br></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><p>ðŸ“° Use <a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/rss.xml>this link</a> for the RSS feed. <br> âœ… Follow me on <a href=https://twitter.com/learn_byexample>Twitter</a>, <a href=https://github.com/learnbyexample>GitHub</a> and <a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/learnbyexample42>Youtube</a> for interesting tech nuggets. <br> ðŸ“§ Subscribe to <a href=https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/learnbyexample-weekly>learnbyexample weekly</a> for programming resources, tips, tools, free ebooks and more (free newsletter, delivered every Friday).<hr color=#e6e6e6></div></article></div></main></div><script src=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/even.js></script>
