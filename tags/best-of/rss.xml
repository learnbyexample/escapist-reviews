            <title>Favorite fantasy and sci-fi novels I read in 2021</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve read 80+ fictional novels in 2021, including re-reads. Most of them were fantasy, rest would fall under sci-fi and magical realism.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picking favorites is a tough task, so I have ordered the top list by dates I read them. I&#x27;ve also listed honorable mentions at the end.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The links lead to the book page on goodreads, from where I&#x27;ve also copied a portion of the blurbs for this post.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <title>10 favorite fictional books I read in 2020</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I read 97 fictional novels in 2020, including re-reads. Most of them were fantasy, rest would fall under sci-fi and magical realism. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years back, I would finish a book no matter how difficult or boring it was. Not so anymore, I had at least three DNF this year â€” one was too dark for my tastes and the other two were too boring.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picking favorites is a tough task and choosing the order of presentation even more so. I&#x27;ve gone with books I enjoyed the most and these are all great candidates for future re-reads. I am not so good with rating prose, characters, worldbuilding, plot holes, etc anyway.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
