We don't get to see how Mages learn and graduate. They have different specializations, magical strength, etc. Damien wants to be a starship mage and has some special talents (though I wasn't sure how that wasn't spotted/reported by his peers and teachers before graduation). Knowledge and tools available for Mages were controlled by those in power, which led to some interesting twists in this book.<p>Writing was easy to follow, except some of the science heavy descriptions. Characters were okayish, not much to praise about how they were written. And this book really needs another round of editing â€” at minimum to remove typos, words with similar meanings next to each other, missing punctuation, etc. My own writings have such problems too, so I probably shouldn't be pointing fingers.<p>Also, as mentioned in the blurb, this was originally written as five episodes. Would have been better if reminders at the start of episodes were edited out to read better as a single book.<p><em>My rating:</em> ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸâ˜† (3.5 stars, bumped up to 4 since it is self-published and author's early work)<h3 id=what-others-are-saying>What others are saying</h3><p>From <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1863386647>Zad's review on goodreads</a>:<blockquote><p>I started to read this series because I like Glynn Stewarts Castle Federation series, and his writing style. I had my doubts about merging magic and fantasy with sci-fi and technology. I must say that I was thoroughly surprised.</blockquote><p>From <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2096653036>Rachel's review on goodreads</a>:<blockquote><p>The world-building was definitely the best part of this novel. As a piece of science fiction with elements of fantasy, this story reminded me a bit of Star Wars. Unfortunately, the characters were very weak, particularly the females. Overall, it was a decent escapist read.</blockquote><h2 id=bingo>Bingo</h2><p><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ttrev1/official_rfantasy_2022_book_bingo_challenge/>/r/Fantasy/ 2022 bingo categories</a>:<ul><li>Set in Space (HM)<li>Self-Published OR Indie Publisher<li>No Ifs, Ands, or Buts</ul></div><div class=post-footer><div class=post-tags><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/science-fiction/>#science-fiction</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/space/>#space</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/fantasy/>#fantasy</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/self-published/>#self-published</a></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><div class=post-nav><p><a class=previous href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/shadow-of-a-dead-god/>â€¹ Shadow of a Dead God: fast paced fantasy mystery</a><br><p><a class=next href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/the-umbral-storm/>The Umbral Storm: engaging epic fantasy with progression magic system â€º</a><br></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><p>ðŸ“° Use <a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/rss.xml>this link</a> for the RSS feed. <br> âœ… Follow me on <a href=https://twitter.com/learn_byexample>Twitter</a>, <a href=https://github.com/learnbyexample>GitHub</a> and <a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/learnbyexample42>Youtube</a> for interesting tech nuggets. <br> ðŸ“§ Subscribe to <a href=https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/learnbyexample-weekly>learnbyexample weekly</a> for programming resources, tips, tools, free ebooks and more (free newsletter, delivered every Friday).<hr color=#e6e6e6></div></article></div></main></div><script src=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/even.js></script>
