Give them a shot if they sound interesting.<p>The links lead to the book page on goodreads, from where I've also copied a portion of the blurbs for this post.</p><span id=continue-reading></span><p align=center><img alt="Book covers" src=/escapist-reviews/images/book_covers/collage_jan_feb_2024.jpg><h2 id=ravenwood-by-nathan-lowell><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13064622-ravenwood>Ravenwood</a> by <strong>Nathan Lowell</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>You're never too old to make a bad decision. After twenty winters on the road, Tanyth Fairport makes one last pilgrimage in her quest to learn all she can about the herbs and medicinal plants of Korlay before settling down to write her magnum opus. Her journey is interrupted when she decides to help a small village and learns that much of what she knows of the world may not be quite as it seems. Nathan Lowell blends wiccan tradition and shamanistic lore into a fantasy quest for a new - if unlikely - heroine. She learns that the familiar sometimes hides the fantastic and that, even when you think you’ve made your decisions, life doesn’t always agree.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>I liked this for the most part. A hamlet thankful for Tanyth to replace their old healer and then having to fend off unwanted guests. Tanyth staying at one spot for months after decades of travel. And a bit of magic. The pacing was steady, with a bit of action mixed with slice-of-life scenes. I would've preferred if the story had focused more on the inn.<hr><h2 id=druid-s-oak-farm-by-susanna-scott><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/143424506-druid-s-oak-farm>Druid's Oak Farm</a> by <strong>Susanna Scott</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>When Maeve McQuaid loses her boyfriend and her gardening job in one fell swoop, fate intervenes in the shape of Beth, an elderly lady carrying a gap-year-size backpack. She turns out to be the owner of the mysterious Druid's Oak Farm in North Yorkshire and offers her a job. The farm is an artist's community which has become tired and run down, much like its inhabitants. The Elizabethan building needs to be saved but Beth is slowly going bankrupt. Can Maeve make a formal garden from an overgrown shambles? Can her enthusiasm lift everyone out of their lethargy or will they rise up against her ideas?</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>This was a short and sweet cozy novel, with a bit of magical realism thrown in. Characters (including the dog) were the main highlight, even though we didn't get much in terms of depth given the short nature of the book. Writing was easy to follow, though descriptions got a bit tedious to focus on.<p>The main plot was about saving the retreat (for artists and the like). Among other things, we got interesting anecdotes about druids mixed with historical events. And some romantic sub-plots too. Overall, a pleasing comfort read.<hr><h2 id=sweet-bean-paste-by-durian-sukegawa-alison-watts-translator><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33376821-sweet-bean-paste>Sweet Bean Paste</a> by <strong>Durian Sukegawa, Alison Watts (Translator)</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Sentaro has failed. He has a criminal record, drinks too much, and his dream of becoming a writer is just a distant memory. With only the blossoming of the cherry trees to mark the passing of time, he spends his days in a tiny confectionery shop selling dorayaki, a type of pancake filled with sweet bean paste. But everything is about to change.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>This was a mix of cozy and uncomfortable things. I wasn't sure if I liked the book, but I found myself turning the pages nonetheless. It did end with a poignant message, and I think it's good to read such stuff now and then.<hr><h2 id=a-fellowship-of-bakers-magic-by-j-penner><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195213451-a-fellowship-of-bakers-magic>A Fellowship of Bakers & Magic</a> by <strong>J. Penner</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>A human, a dwarf and an elf walk into a bake-off… In the heart of Adenashire, where elfish enchantments and dwarven delights rule, Arleta Starstone, a human confectionist works twice as hard perfecting her unique blend of baking and apothecary herbs. So when an orc neighbor secretly enters her creations into the prestigious Elven Baking Battle, Arleta faces a dilemma.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>This had plenty of cozy moments but also lot of drama and emotional content that it wasn't a fully comfort read that I was hoping for. I especially liked the characters and some of the worldbuilding elements.<hr><h2 id=crazy-foolish-robots-by-adeena-mignogna><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59118352-crazy-foolish-robots>Crazy Foolish Robots</a> by <strong>Adeena Mignogna</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Ruby Palmer finds herself on an entire planet surrounded by the things she hates the most: robots. Besides taking everything she says way too literally, the robots have problems of their own. A myriad of technical glitches are, on the cosmological scale, quickly destroying them. Ruby has the programming knowledge and skills that matter to them, but can she overcome her fears and find it within herself to help? Her survival, along with the survival of all of humanity and robot kind, depends on it.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>Nice sci-fi novella that was just what I needed to get a break from reading too many progression fantasy books. The tone was light with humor shining here and there. The pacing was good enough that you'd not feel bored. The plot was okayish, though that's a little tougher to comment on given that it is part of a series.</div><div class=post-footer><div class=post-tags><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/2024/>#2024</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/mini-reviews/>#mini-reviews</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/fantasy/>#fantasy</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/science-fiction/>#science-fiction</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/whimsical/>#whimsical</a></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><div class=post-nav><p><a class=previous href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/eight-progression-fantasy-mini-reviews-jan-feb-2024/>‹ Mini reviews for eight progression fantasy books</a><br><p><a class=next href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/dear-spellbook/>Dear Spellbook: engaging time-loop progression fantasy ›</a><br></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><p>📰 Use <a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/rss.xml>this link</a> for the RSS feed. <br> ✅ Follow me on <a href=https://twitter.com/learn_byexample>Twitter</a>, <a href=https://github.com/learnbyexample>GitHub</a> and <a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/learnbyexample42>Youtube</a> for interesting tech nuggets. <br> 📧 Subscribe to <a href=https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/learnbyexample-weekly>learnbyexample weekly</a> for programming resources, tips, tools, free ebooks and more (free newsletter, delivered every Friday).<hr color=#e6e6e6></div></article></div></main></div><script src=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/even.js></script>
