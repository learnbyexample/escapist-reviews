When Detective Marasi Colms and her partner Wayne find stockpiled weapons bound for the Outer City of Bilming, this opens a new lead. Conflict between Elendel and the Outer Cities only favors the Set, and their tendrils now reach to the Elendel Senateâ€”whose corruption Wax and Steris have sought to exposeâ€”and Bilming is even more entangled.<p>After Wax discovers a new type of explosive that can unleash unprecedented destruction and realizes that the Set must already have it, an immortal kandra serving Scadrialâ€™s god reveals that Harmonyâ€™s power is blocked in Bilming. That means the city has fallen under the influence of another god: Trell, worshipped by the Set. And Trell isnâ€™t the only factor at play from the larger Cosmereâ€”Marasi is recruited by offworlders with strange abilities who claim their goal is to protect Scadrial...at any cost.</blockquote><h2 id=review><p style="color: #7e0b5f">Review</h2><p>I re-read the first three books of Mistborn Era 2 as it's been a long while (6 years) since the last book was released. My interest in Cosmere has waned (pun intended) significantly â€” too many books and these days I hate it when main characters and their friends/family suffer a lot. Every book took multiple days to finish (compared to single day binges during the height of my Sanderson obsession). Still, I found myself enjoying some of the things I loved about Sanderson's books (worldbuilding, magic system, action, twists, etc). This changed experience extended to the latest release as well.<p>Overall, it was a good ending to the series in terms of plot and action (though some of it was a rehash from Era 1). Plenty of Cosmere crossovers and cool powers on display. At the same time, lots of hints, questions and mysteries which will likely take years/decades to unravel. Sanderson seems like a big fan of heroic deaths, so even though it was emotionally impactful when it came, it wasn't a surprise.<p>I'd say all the main protagonists had good characterization throughout the series. Antagonists were fine in the earlier books, but one of the main villains in this book with credible threat was really disappointing in terms of character.<p>I loved the epilogues and at the same time really dislike some of the implications.<p><em>My rating:</em> ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸâ˜†<h3 id=what-others-are-saying><p style="color: #a0494c">What others are saying</h3><p>From <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1763338771>Petrik's review on goodreads</a>:<blockquote><p>The Lost Metal is a spectacular and explosive ending to Mistborn: Wax and Wayne series. It is a half Mistborn half Cosmere crossovers novel.</blockquote><p>From <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5065848791>The Wulver's Library's review on goodreads</a>:<blockquote><p>What really surprised me is the emotion that was portrayed in this story. There were so many resonating quotes and actions that I really took heart to. I'm not going to spoil anything, obviously, but Sanderson has really taken things to different heights with the resolutions in this book and just when I thought it couldn't get any better, it reeled me right back in.</blockquote><h2 id=bingo><p style="color: #7e0b5f">Bingo</h2><p><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ttrev1/official_rfantasy_2022_book_bingo_challenge/>/r/Fantasy/ 2022 bingo categories</a>:<ul><li>Cool Weapon<li>Published in 2022<li>Urban Fantasy<li>Wibbly Wobbly Timey Wimey (HM)<li>Shapeshifters (HM)<li>Family Matters</ul></div><div class=post-footer><div class=post-tags><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/fantasy/>#fantasy</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/epic/>#epic</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/urban/>#urban</a></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><div class=post-nav><p><a class=previous href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/miss-percys-travel-guide-to-welsh-moors-and-feral-dragons/>â€¹ Miss Percy's Travel Guide to Welsh Moors and Feral Dragons: cozy historical fantasy</a><br><p><a class=next href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/carly-piper-and-the-mystery-of-the-ruby-ring/>Carly Piper and the Mystery of the Ruby Ring: cozy mystery â€º</a><br></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><p>ðŸ“° Use <a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/rss.xml>this link</a> for the RSS feed. <br> âœ… Follow me on <a href=https://twitter.com/learn_byexample>Twitter</a>, <a href=https://github.com/learnbyexample>GitHub</a> and <a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/learnbyexample42>Youtube</a> for interesting tech nuggets. <br> ðŸ“§ Subscribe to <a href=https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/learnbyexample-weekly>learnbyexample weekly</a> for programming resources, tips, tools, free ebooks and more (free newsletter, delivered every Friday).<hr color=#e6e6e6></div></article></div></main></div><script src=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/even.js></script>
