But there's more brewing under the surface of this cityâ€”hidden magic, and hidden machinationsâ€”that threaten all the people who've helped her make her own way.<p>Miyara may not be a princess anymore, but with a teapot in hand she'll risk her newfound freedom to discover a more meaningful kind of power.</blockquote><h2 id=review><p style="color: #7e0b5f">Review</h2><p>This was a delightful read. After consuming too many action filled progression fantasy, I wanted something different and this turned out to be the perfect choice. I didn't know that the book was politically focused, which was good because I might have skipped this book otherwise.<p>There really wasn't much in terms of action, but the pacing was great throughout thanks to a good plot with a bit of mystery and skillfully crafted tension between characters. The romantic sub-plots were fine, but I wish there were more POVs to get a better feel for their experiences.<p>The different ways of performing magic were intriguing and played a significant role in the plot even though we don't get much in terms of details. I especially liked that magecraft could be learned as a skill and yet had a neat restriction.<p>The tea ceremony was very interesting. Initially, I found it a bit hard to believe the kind of training tea masters had to go through until I got a better sense of what they did (hint: it's not just about concocting tea). Overall, despite the higher stakes and emotional stuff, this was a heartwarming read.<p><em>My rating:</em> ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ<h3 id=what-others-are-saying><p style="color: #a0494c">What others are saying</h3><p>From <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5047541581>Intisar Khanani's review on goodreads</a>:<blockquote><p>This is very much a story of a privileged person learning to leverage their abilities and knowledge to act as an ally, while both protecting those they are supporting and doing their best to center their voices. It's a delicate balance, and Miyara doesn't always get it right, but kudos to Blair for writing a story that models allyship in a fantasy setting.</blockquote><p>From <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4840409577>Kevin's review on goodreads</a>:<blockquote><p>Overall, I found this to be a delightful YA fantasy adventure with a princess finding herself and her way in a new setting. I would have absolutely adored this as a young teen, and enjoyed it as an adult. I think it has very nice messages built into it as well, and would definitely recommend it to those its written for.</blockquote></div><div class=post-footer><div class=post-tags><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/fantasy/>#fantasy</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/slice-of-life/>#slice-of-life</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/self-published/>#self-published</a></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><div class=post-nav><p><a class=previous href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/five-mini-reviews-sep-oct-2023/>â€¹ Five mini reviews</a><br><p><a class=next href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/cant-spell-treason-without-tea/>Can't Spell Treason Without Tea: cozy-ish mixed with higher stakes â€º</a><br></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><p>ðŸ“° Use <a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/rss.xml>this link</a> for the RSS feed. <br> âœ… Follow me on <a href=https://twitter.com/learn_byexample>Twitter</a>, <a href=https://github.com/learnbyexample>GitHub</a> and <a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/learnbyexample42>Youtube</a> for interesting tech nuggets. <br> ðŸ“§ Subscribe to <a href=https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/learnbyexample-weekly>learnbyexample weekly</a> for programming resources, tips, tools, free ebooks and more (free newsletter, delivered every Friday).<hr color=#e6e6e6></div></article></div></main></div><script src=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/even.js></script>
