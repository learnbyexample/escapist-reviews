She finds herself deep in the bizzarre, savage forests of the unclaimed lands where deadly monsters prowl in the shadows just out of sight.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>A fun read. Similar and yet different enough from other litrpg style novels. I liked the slice-of-life aspects more than the action. Stat sheets were a bit annoying but they were better done than what I've seen before. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for an easy to read, fast paced and enjoyable book. Looking forward to read the sequels.<hr><h2 id=harpyness-is-only-skin-deep-by-d-h-willison><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53332248-harpyness-is-only-skin-deep>Harpyness is Only Skin Deep</a> by <strong>D.H. Willison</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Darin: bored with his paper pusher existence, he accepts a questionable deal for the LARP adventure of a lifetime. A jump through a dimensional portal strands him on the mythical world of Arvia, where everything is gigantic. Except the life-expectancy of newcomers.</blockquote><blockquote><p>Rinloh: a mere ten meters tall. Life in the harpy flock has never been easy for her. Determined to become full-fledged at the upcoming human-hunt, nothing is going to stand–or fly–in her way.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>I liked the concept and the fantasy world setting. Plot was okayish. Writing was mostly good, with clever chapter naming. But the mix of present tense and past tense was jarring and some chapters suddenly gave a little refresher of events that happened in the past few chapters. The ending seemed like there'd be more books in this setting, but you can read this one as a standalone too. I'd definitely recommend it if you aren't looking for something serious.<hr><h2 id=the-trials-of-morrigan-crow-by-jessica-townsend><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34219873-the-trials-of-morrigan-crow>The Trials of Morrigan Crow</a> by <strong>Jessica Townsend</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Morrigan Crow is cursed. Having been born on Eventide, the unluckiest day for any child to be born, she's blamed for all local misfortunes, from hailstorms to heart attacks--and, worst of all, the curse means that Morrigan is doomed to die at midnight on her eleventh birthday.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>Liked it for the most part. Would've probably loved it very much during my early days of reading. Characters were all well fleshed out, but I wish there were different POVs to give them more depth. I saw the book recommended for school/university setting, but that turned out to be just the titular trials to get accepted instead of actual schooling.<hr><h2 id=pilgrim-by-harmon-cooper><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54640112-pilgrim>Pilgrim</a> by <strong>Harmon Cooper</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Abandoned at birth and raised to be an assassin by the mysterious Diyu Brotherhood, Danzen Ravja has had enough of the life of a contract killer. After completing his disastrous last assignment, he slips away to the remote Genshin Valley hoping to disappear for good.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>Liked this slice-of-life take in a progression fantasy setting (although progression elements were muted and hinted at, probably will come up in later books). The events became a bit repetitive and I felt the book could easily have been reduced by 25-50%.<hr><h2 id=the-keeper-chronicles-by-j-a-andrews><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45026127-the-keeper-chronicles>The Keeper Chronicles</a> by <strong>J.A. Andrews</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>It will take the Keepers of legend to save Queensland. Too bad all they’ve got is a man haunted by his past, a failure at magic, and an untrained girl.</blockquote><blockquote><p>Mallon the Undying’s reign of terror ended eight years ago when he entered the elven wood and never returned. The country of Queensland has shakily returned to normal, and the Keepers who helped defend her have returned to their own pursuits as historians, storytellers, and studiers of magic.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>Overall, an enjoyable trilogy, mostly on the lighter side compared to other gritty epic fantasy series. I liked the central idea of magic users also being in charge of historical record, preserving and serving as advisers to the rulers. The main strength of the series is the characters, each book having a different POV character. I liked the magic system, but I felt it a bit odd that the Keepers weren't familiar with many aspects of the magic despite centuries of knowledge. I'd have enjoyed the series more if the central conflict didn't have so much of compulsion/influence based plot as I don't like that trope.<hr><h2 id=a-new-beginning-by-j-e-thompson><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53310083-a-new-beginning>A New Beginning</a> by <strong>J E Thompson</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Vexx White is a down on his luck apprentice mage, recently expelled from Fallanden Magical Academy for experimenting with necromancy. With nothing to lose, he becomes a dungeoneer for hire—taking odd jobs in his home town of Cloudbury for pocket change. Nine out of ten dungeoneers die in their first ten quests, and to survive Vexx finds himself teaming up with a clumsy elf and a crazed succubus. When they’re not busy trying to kill each other, the dungeoneers drum up all the work they can get, from raiding dungeons to hunting down thieves.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>Humor can be hit/miss with me, and I usually don't like the kind used often in this book (adult stuff), but they got a laugh out of me. The book is fast paced action, with one quest following right after the previous one finished, sometimes multiple quests on the same day. I'd have loved a bit more world building, character growth, etc but I don't think the author intends to go in that direction. Just a fast paced fun to read novel, ideal as a palate cleanser between epic fantasies.<hr><h2 id=catching-cinders-by-kendra-merritt><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52844260-catching-cinders>Catching Cinders</a> by <strong>Kendra Merritt</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Crippled from a childhood illness, Cindy lives in the kitchen fireplace, ignored by her noble father and his new, perfect family, helping the people no one else notices. But when he dies under mysterious circumstances, Cindy’s step-mother coerces her into an elaborate plot to avoid being charged with murder.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>I enjoyed this romance novel despite being a bit skeptical if I'll like yet another Cindrella story. I'd say the novel stands on its own - magic and politics blended nicely with a love story. The lead characters were both likeable, and the side characters were good too. The prose was easy to follow. I hope I can check out the other novels set in this world soon.<hr><h2 id=the-wounded-kingdom-by-r-j-barker><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33296298-age-of-assassins>The Wounded Kingdom</a> by <strong>R.J. Barker</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Girton Club-foot, apprentice to the land's best assassin, still has much to learn about the art of taking lives. But his latest mission tasks him and his master with a far more difficult challenge: to save a life. Someone, or many someones, is trying to kill the heir to the throne, and it is up to Girton and his master to uncover the traitor and prevent the prince's murder.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>Too dark for me. Somehow managed to read two books before dropping it for good.<hr><h2 id=dragontamer-s-daughters-by-kenton-kilgore><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25963520-dragontamer-s-daughters>Dragontamer's Daughters</a> by <strong>Kenton Kilgore</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Two girls find a dragon like no other—and their lives will never be the same!</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>I didn't remember why I had put this book on TBR. The first few chapters read like a slice-of-life fantasy for middle-grade/young-adult readers and it was interesting enough for me to keep reading. Then it went into dark fantasy territory with a bit of graphic detail. For the most part, the book is slice-of-life but the "grown-up" parts read like a dark fantasy novel. Personally, I'd would've enjoyed more if the entire book was light-hearted and slice-of-life, but it would've have been a very different book.<hr><h2 id=moving-pictures-by-terry-pratchett><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34510.Moving_Pictures>Moving Pictures</a> by <strong>Terry Pratchett</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>'Holy wood is a different sort of place. People act differently here. Everywhere else the most important things are gods or money or cattle. Here, the most important thing is to be important.'</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>This was a funny take at Hollywood (Holy wood in the book for more than one reason) and I liked most of the characters. Especially the trolls and the dogs and even the wizards.<hr><h2 id=the-lost-city-of-ithos-by-john-bierce><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54551683-the-lost-city-of-ithos>The Lost City of Ithos</a> by <strong>John Bierce</strong></h2><p><strong>Review</strong><p>I re-read the first three books in preparation for beta-reading this book (I'm more of a gamma reader really). The re-read was very much needed at that time, helped me overcome a bad week. This is the best book of the series yet. Plenty of action, training, monsters, wonder cities and hilarious antics from spellbook. The last two books (may be more?) should provide an exciting finish, can't wait for them.<hr><h2 id=god-of-gnomes-by-demi-harper><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51997446-god-of-gnomes>God of Gnomes</a> by <strong>Demi Harper</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Deep beneath the earth, Corey finds himself reborn as a God Core – a sentient crystal with unusual powers. His new worshipers? A colony of incompetent gnomes, scratching out an existence in their underground grotto.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>Exactly the kind of fun read I needed to take a break from work. Easy to read, plenty of action and progression elements. The concept of god core as a variation of dungeon core was well done. The choice of gnomes seemed odd, but the author does a good job of making you root for them. The ending felt a bit rushed though. Would have liked a few chapters after the climax, though I suppose that'll be covered in the sequel. Looking forward to it.<p>See <a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/posts/exodus-of-gnomes-review/>Exodus of Gnomes: a delightful sequel</a> for my review on the sequel.<hr><h2 id=the-last-sun-by-k-d-edwards><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36466732-the-last-sun>The Last Sun</a> by <strong>K.D. Edwards</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Rune Saint John, last child of the fallen Sun Court, is hired to search for Lady Judgment's missing son, Addam, on New Atlantis, the island city where the Atlanteans moved after ordinary humans destroyed their original home.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>Liked it overall, despite not fully understanding the urban lingo and culture of the western world. I'm spoiled by progression fantasy books, so throughout the book I craved to understand better how the characters used magic and where they stood in relation to the side they were fighting. There were at least two big moments where the MC did some new magic, seemingly in a deus ex machina sort of way. The book does indicate they'll be explained in future books, but I won't be reading as reviews indicate events get much darker than the tone in this book.<hr><h2 id=the-book-in-the-bottle-by-raymond-st-elmo><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31312595-the-book-in-the-bottle>The Book in the Bottle</a> by <strong>Raymond St. Elmo</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>A family finds a mysterious bottle. Within the bottle, a book. Within the book, a story. And within the story is a city built of pieces. In that city is a beggar who became a duke, a rat who becomes a cat, a song that became a promise. Ghosts, assassins, kings and cobblers shift and dance across this city, finding who they are by what story they tell of themselves. And in the very center of the dance, a man stands balanced on a wheel.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>My first adventure with Raymond St. Elmo. Overall enjoyed the book, but it took me about half way mark to get comfortable with author's style. I don't think I got all the subtle hints and nods to literary references, but the intention is easy to grasp. By the end of the book, you can't but help wishing to be part of the family who found the bottle ;)<p>This'll fit well for those looking for a Halloween themed book.<hr><h2 id=prayer-for-the-storm-by-adrian-kaas><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43447475-prayer-for-the-storm>Prayer for the Storm</a> by <strong>Adrian Kaas</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>High in the mountains is a ruined temple for a forgotten god. Long has the construct, Itakkæ, been in limbo there, waiting through season after season for their stone to be brought down to nothing more than dust. But then an alchemist arrives on a journey of her own, a swirl of violence following in her wake.</blockquote><blockquote><p>Bound together in blood, the two journey to the lowlands with Itakkæ navigating the strangeness of a world they'd never known.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong>: This was a short and thought provoking read. It is fast paced, writing was easy to follow and there's action to keep you interested. What made it good was the questions asked for those actions and the way characters tried to reason it out. This could certainly have been a full length novel, which could've made a longer lasting impression.<hr><h2 id=dawntreader-by-miles-arlington><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55145995-dawntreader>Dawntreader</a> by <strong>Miles Arlington</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>A necromancer with twisted visions of utopia seeks to raise a city of the dead. An elf leaves home to meet the undead legions, a journey that ultimately leaves her with more doubts than she'd ever allowed herself. A trio of engineers dabble in powers that may forever change the history of Talum. A wayward prince, thinking himself freed from duties expected of him, must escape the long arm of his people.</blockquote><blockquote><p>Dawntreader is a tale of threads, each perspective turning inexorably toward the others and joining - a tangled skein of relationships, intrigue, tragedy and triumph. Heroism takes many forms: A valiant charge, a shoulder offered, a simple gesture to a friend in dire need.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong>: This book had a lot of cool moments, so many memorable characters and places and lore. But it would have needed at least twice the size of the book to give justice to all the characters and events, perhaps something approaching the length of Stormlight Archives and the depth of Sanderson's world building. As this is the author's debut, I hope the process of writing the first book leads to much improved ones in the future. This book tells a complete story on its own, but so many threads are left open for future books.</div><div class=post-footer><div class=post-tags><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/2020/>#2020</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/mini-reviews/>#mini-reviews</a></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><div class=post-nav><p><a class=previous href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/half-a-soul/>‹ Half a Soul: wholesome romance and fantastic banter</a><br></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><p>📰 Use <a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/rss.xml>this link</a> for the RSS feed. <br> ✅ Follow me on <a href=https://twitter.com/learn_byexample>Twitter</a>, <a href=https://github.com/learnbyexample>GitHub</a> and <a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/learnbyexample42>Youtube</a> for interesting tech nuggets. <br> 📧 Subscribe to <a href=https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/learnbyexample-weekly>learnbyexample weekly</a> for programming resources, tips, tools, free ebooks and more (free newsletter, delivered every Friday).<hr color=#e6e6e6></div></article></div></main></div><script src=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/even.js></script>
