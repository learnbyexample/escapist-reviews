Duck-obsessed knights. Plungdugglers.<p>Rhev must face it all in a race against time across the length of the Peninsula. His quest: to deliver a package before his soul is taken from him. The road was always going to be bumpy, but Rhev might come away with what he's always wanted: the chance to be a hero.<p>Stout is a whimsical and somewhat satirical take on the fantasy adventure genre. Heartwarming, hilarious, and hair-raising!</blockquote><h2 id=review>Review</h2><p>I had a great start to this month, with a re-read followed by three books that I enjoyed a lot. Then, I had to DNF two books in a row! I struggled a bit reading Stout as well, but overall I had plenty of fun reading it.<p>When I started reading, I immediately noticed there were no chapters. At first I thought it was due to some technical difficulty faced by a self-published author. As I kept reading, I realized it was perhaps a delibrate choice, given all the Discworld vibes I was noticing. After finishing the novel, I was more confident that the entire novel was some sort of a love letter to Terry Pratchett (which was confirmed after I checked the <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/u1310a/seeking_adventure_my_debut_novel_is_free_today/>post by the author</a> that put this book on my TBR list).<p>I'd say humor, puns, worldbuilding and characters were all well written. Not just the main characters, but every side character too. Hat tip to the author for this quote by a minor sidekick character:<blockquote><p>'Do they make them going forwards and backwards, instead of up and down? I spend lots more time going forwards and backwards,' mused Grunthry.</blockquote><p>Especially because I had been thinking how such characters are mostly just cannon fodder to elicit laughs in action scenes before this came up. I don't usually note down quotes to be posted in reviews, but this made me take the effort to stop reading and type the words.<p>There were plenty of sub-plots in this book that came together at the end. Some of these resulted in character growth, powerful emotional scenes, etc. With so much packed into this novel, I feel that a re-read would be very rewarding too.<p><em>My rating:</em> ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸâ˜†<h3 id=what-others-are-saying>What others are saying</h3><p>From <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4709164223>Leon's review on goodreads</a>:<blockquote><p>A wonderful self contained fantasy story with a good helping of humour and action and characters who feel like people, not just 2D cutouts. I particularly enjoyed one of the sideplots which leads into the ending. Excellently written, thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend!</blockquote><p>From <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4663181671>Stephanie's review on goodreads</a>:<blockquote><p>The story, the characters, and the setting all remind me of Pratchett's style while also being the authors own voice. Many times I found myself laughing at the situations and descriptions and hated when I had to put it down to sleep. I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a lighthearted adventure through a creative and interesting world.</blockquote><h2 id=bingo>Bingo</h2><p><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ttrev1/official_rfantasy_2022_book_bingo_challenge/>/r/Fantasy/ 2022 bingo categories</a>:<ul><li>Standalone (HM)<li>Anti-Hero<li>Cool Weapon (HM)<li>Revolutions and Rebellions<li>Published in 2022 (HM)<li>Non-Human Protagonist<li>Self-Published OR Indie Publisher (HM)<li>Shapeshifters (HM)<li>No Ifs, Ands, or Buts<li>Family Matters</ul></div><div class=post-footer><div class=post-tags><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/fantasy/>#fantasy</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/humor/>#humor</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/self-published/>#self-published</a></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><div class=post-nav><p><a class=previous href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/soul-relic/>â€¹ Soul Relic: wholesome adventure in progression fantasy setting</a><br><p><a class=next href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/seven-mini-reviews-apr-june-2022/>Seven mini reviews â€º</a><br></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><p>ðŸ“° Use <a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/rss.xml>this link</a> for the RSS feed. <br> âœ… Follow me on <a href=https://twitter.com/learn_byexample>Twitter</a>, <a href=https://github.com/learnbyexample>GitHub</a> and <a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/learnbyexample42>Youtube</a> for interesting tech nuggets. <br> ðŸ“§ Subscribe to <a href=https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/learnbyexample-weekly>learnbyexample weekly</a> for programming resources, tips, tools, free ebooks and more (free newsletter, delivered every Friday).<hr color=#e6e6e6></div></article></div></main></div><script src=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/even.js></script>
