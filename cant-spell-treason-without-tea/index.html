Worn wooden floors, plants on every table, firelight drifting between the raftersâ€¦ all complemented by love and good company. Thing is, Reyna works as one of the Queen's private guards, and Kianthe is the most powerful mage in existence. Leaving their lives isn't so easy.<p>But after an assassin takes Reyna hostage, she decides she's thoroughly done risking her life for a self-centered queen. Meanwhile, Kianthe has been waiting for a chance to flee responsibilityâ€“all the better that her girlfriend is on board. Together, they settle in Tawney, a town that boasts more dragons than people, and open the shop of their dreams.<p>What follows is a cozy tale of mishaps, mysteries, and a murderous queen throwing the realm's biggest temper tantrum. In a story brimming with hurt/comfort and quiet fireside conversations, these two women will discover just what they mean to each otherâ€¦ and the world.</blockquote><h2 id=review><p style="color: #7e0b5f">Review</h2><p>I wouldn't recommend this book under the cozy umbrella alone. There certainly were plenty of cozy elements but stakes were reasonably high throughout the book. That said, these days I do prefer books with higher stakes mixed with slice-of-life scenes (is there a term for such books?).<p>Writing was easy to follow and the pacing was good throughout. The main characters were easy to root for given their goal of opening a shop in a remote place. The side characters from the town were nice as well (some took a while), but I wish they had a lot more screen time. That would've lent a more cozy feeling. I loved the griffon companion and hope there's more of them in the sequels.<p>I'd say the plot was going well, until the rather lame resolution at the end. One of the sub-plots that I was more interested in didn't get a resolution and the blurb of the sequel doesn't seem promising on that point. Still, I'm looking forward to read it.<p><em>My rating:</em> ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸâ˜†<h3 id=what-others-are-saying><p style="color: #a0494c">What others are saying</h3><p>From <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4954609771>ChloÃ«'s review on goodreads</a>:<blockquote><p>It's fun, welcoming and easy to read. It allows you to fantasize about how you would fit into this magical world. The book balanced cosiness and adventure well, with stakes high enough to avoid falling into repetition or boredom but not so high they take away the cosy part. I'm also a big fan of Reyna and Kianthe's relationship, as it was noticably realistic and healthy.</blockquote><p>From <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5109169911>AnnMaree Of Oz's review on goodreads</a>:<blockquote><p>This was a lovely, fun, story that I think anyone who ever had that cottagecore dream where you run away with your spouse and open a little bookshop cafe, in an accepting community with good friends; will enjoy!</blockquote></div><div class=post-footer><div class=post-tags><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/fantasy/>#fantasy</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/slice-of-life/>#slice-of-life</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/self-published/>#self-published</a></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><div class=post-nav><p><a class=previous href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/a-coup-of-tea/>â€¹ A Coup of Tea: a delightful read</a><br><p><a class=next href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/silvers/>Silvers (Quest Academy #1): great mix of magical academy, crafting and slice-of-life â€º</a><br></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><p>ðŸ“° Use <a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/rss.xml>this link</a> for the RSS feed. <br> âœ… Follow me on <a href=https://twitter.com/learn_byexample>Twitter</a>, <a href=https://github.com/learnbyexample>GitHub</a> and <a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/learnbyexample42>Youtube</a> for interesting tech nuggets. <br> ðŸ“§ Subscribe to <a href=https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/learnbyexample-weekly>learnbyexample weekly</a> for programming resources, tips, tools, free ebooks and more (free newsletter, delivered every Friday).<hr color=#e6e6e6></div></article></div></main></div><script src=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/even.js></script>
