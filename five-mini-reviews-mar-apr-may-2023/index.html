Give them a shot if they sound interesting.<p>The links lead to the book page on goodreads, from where I've also copied a portion of the blurbs for this post.</p><span id=continue-reading></span><hr><h2 id=knightmare-arcanist-by-shami-stovall><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45287676-knightmare-arcanist>Knightmare Arcanist</a> by <strong>Shami Stovall</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Magic. Sailing. A murderer among heroes. Gravedigger Volke Savan wants nothing more than to be like his hero, the legendary magical swashbuckler, Gregory Ruma. First he needs to become an arcanist, someone capable of wielding magic, which requires bonding with a mythical creature. And he’ll take anything—a pegasus, a griffin, a ravenous hydra—maybe even a leviathan, like Ruma.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>Overall, I liked the magic system and the group of young arcanists coming together at the end. The writing was easy to follow and the pacing was good too.<p>I didn't much like the plot though. Corrupting magic that makes people behave differently than they would've otherwise. The master arcanists seemed a bit incompetent at times. Also, it felt odd that the training didn't involve arcanists in the middle stage — we got to see only students with newly gained powers and veteran arcanists.<hr><h2 id=murder-at-spindle-manor-by-morgan-stang><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62993337-murder-at-spindle-manor>Murder at Spindle Manor</a> by <strong>Morgan Stang</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Mysteries abound in Spindle Manor. For Huntress Isabeau Agarwal, the countryside inn is the last stop in a deadly hunt. Armed with gaslamp and guns, she tracks an insidious beast that wears the skin of its victims, mimicking them perfectly. Ten guests reside within Spindle Manor tonight, and the creature could be any one of them. Confined by a torrential thunderstorm and running out of time, Isabeau has until morning to discover the liar, or none of them—including her—will make it out alive.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>This was darker than my comfort level in terms of descriptions of past evil deeds and on screen deaths. Most of the side characters were despicable and even the main character was a little brutal for my liking (to be fair, well suited for the role of supernatural Huntress). So, why did I still finish reading this? Worldbuilding and pacing were good. And I enjoyed some of the humor too.<hr><h2 id=a-silvery-moon-by-luis-falcao-de-magalhaes><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45144033-a-silvery-moon>A Silvery Moon</a> by <strong>Luís Falcão de Magalhães</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Inspired by the Forgotten Realms novels of old, "A Silvery Moon" is a new novel in an old genre, a fresh story in a bigger, lived-in, classical fantasy universe. Follow the tale of a trio of adventurers as they figure out the mystery of who's behind the strange happenings in Glonsclim, and witness their growth as they face unspeakable evil and confront impossible odds.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>This was a well written novella. Began with an action scene that set the pacing for the story. I liked all three main characters and how they supported each other. I'd say the author did a good job of mixing the plot with worldbuilding details as needed. It was darker than I'm comfortable with though, especially in the second half. Had to skip/skim gory scenes.<hr><h2 id=brownies-and-broomsticks-by-bailey-cates><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12035966-brownies-and-broomsticks>Brownies and Broomsticks</a> by <strong>Bailey Cates</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Katie Lightfoot's tired of loafing around as the assistant manager of an Ohio bakery. So when her aunt Lucy and uncle Ben open a bakery in Savannah's quaint downtown district and ask Katie to join them, she enthusiastically agrees. While working at the Honeybee Bakery—named after Lucy's cat—Katie notices that her aunt is adding mysterious herbs to her recipes. Turns out these herbal enhancements aren't just tasty—Aunt Lucy is a witch and her recipes are actually spells!</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>Wanted a light-hearted read and this book's title and cover caught my attention. I enjoyed this urban mystery but I wish it had more focus on the baking part. The mystery part kept the pacing good. I loved Mungo the best among all the characters.<hr><h2 id=the-castle-of-tangled-magic-by-sophie-anderson><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54278502-the-castle-of-tangled-magic>The Castle of Tangled Magic</a> by <strong>Sophie Anderson</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Twelve-year-old Olia knows a thing or two about secrets. Her parents are the caretakers of Castle Mila, a soaring palace with golden domes, lush gardens, and countless room. Literally countless rooms. There are rooms that appear and disappear, and rooms that have been hiding themselves for centuries. The only person who can access them is Olia. She has a special bond with the castle, and it seems to trust her with its secrets.<p>But then a violent storm rolls in . . . a storm that skips over the village and surrounds the castle, threatening to tear it apart. While taking cover in a rarely-used room, Olia stumbles down a secret passage that leads to a part of Castle Mila she's never seen before. A strange network of rooms that hide the secret to the castle's past . . . and the truth about who's trying to destroy it.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>I loved the starting few chapters, getting to know the main character, her family and friends, etc. It was cozy. But my interest waned a bit as they crossed over to the magic land, perhaps because the urgent mission with a ticking timer and MC's fears took me out of the cozy feeling. I did like the various magical creatures we meet on the way, and the ending was nice too.</div><div class=post-footer><div class=post-tags><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/2023/>#2023</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/mini-reviews/>#mini-reviews</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/fantasy/>#fantasy</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/urban/>#urban</a></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><div class=post-nav><p><a class=next href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/the-last-echo-of-the-lord-of-bells/>The Last Echo of the Lord of Bells: a fitting conclusion to an epic series ›</a><br></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><p>📰 Use <a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/rss.xml>this link</a> for the RSS feed. <br> ✅ Follow me on <a href=https://twitter.com/learn_byexample>Twitter</a>, <a href=https://github.com/learnbyexample>GitHub</a> and <a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/learnbyexample42>Youtube</a> for interesting tech nuggets. <br> 📧 Subscribe to <a href=https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/learnbyexample-weekly>learnbyexample weekly</a> for programming resources, tips, tools, free ebooks and more (free newsletter, delivered every Friday).<hr color=#e6e6e6></div></article></div></main></div><script src=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/even.js></script>
