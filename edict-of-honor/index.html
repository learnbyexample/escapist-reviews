A dangerous renegade. Both stand in the way of the coterie's first mission.<p>After being sanctioned by Avyleir Library, Roun and his friends find themselves looking forward to their futures as sacred guardians of humanity. Roun knows, however, that their evaluation was only one obstacle along an endless path, and it does not take long before they receive their next challenge: the coterieâ€™s first Copper rank mission.</blockquote><h2 id=review>Review</h2><p>I enjoyed "Edict of Honor" a lot more than <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58510873-awakening-arte>Awakening Arte</a>. Characters were more fleshed out, plenty of action and cool use of magical powers.<p>The book started steadily, which helped me get immersed in this setting again and recall events from the first book. Once the action started, it was enthralling all the way through. What I enjoyed most were the display of magical powers and the combat scenes. They flowed really well with the narrative, thanks to the set up at the start. The main characters from the first book got good attention through their magical progression as well as personal quirks and issues.<p>The new setting and thus new characters were amazing as well. I didn't expect the antagonists to be so varied and interesting in their own ways. One of them got a very memorable scene!<p>I'd highly recommend this series for those who enjoy epic and progression fantasy. Though the setting is dark, there were plenty of light-hearted moments and many characters are honorable and optimistic.<p>It was also good to read the afterword from the author, which explained a few things about the series and what to expect going forward.<p><em>My rating:</em> ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ<h3 id=what-others-are-saying>What others are saying</h3><p>From <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4435881566>Pedro Garcia's review on goodreads</a>:<blockquote><p>The first book presented a world interesting enough to hook me and Edict of Honer doubled down on that, offering more insights into the world and characters. The plot was overall solid, with an interesting approach to the conflict between weak and strong characters that is often seen in progression fantasy.</blockquote><p>From <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4475292782>Dylan Sherman's review on goodreads</a>:<blockquote><p>This series is a slightly different take on progressing ones path than I have ever read before. Roun is a fun main character and I enjoyed the addition of kindred into the story line. Looking forward to the rest of the series.</blockquote></div><div class=post-footer><div class=post-tags><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/progression/>#progression</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/fantasy/>#fantasy</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/comfort-read/>#comfort-read</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/self-published/>#self-published</a></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><div class=post-nav><p><a class=previous href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/six-mini-reviews-dec-2021-jan-2022/>â€¹ Six mini reviews</a><br><p><a class=next href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/weirkey-chronicles/>The Weirkey Chronicles: enjoyable fast paced progression fantasy â€º</a><br></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><p>ðŸ“° Use <a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/rss.xml>this link</a> for the RSS feed. <br> âœ… Follow me on <a href=https://twitter.com/learn_byexample>Twitter</a>, <a href=https://github.com/learnbyexample>GitHub</a> and <a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/learnbyexample42>Youtube</a> for interesting tech nuggets. <br> ðŸ“§ Subscribe to <a href=https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/learnbyexample-weekly>learnbyexample weekly</a> for programming resources, tips, tools, free ebooks and more (free newsletter, delivered every Friday).<hr color=#e6e6e6></div></article></div></main></div><script src=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/even.js></script>
