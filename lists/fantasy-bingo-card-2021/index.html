The writing and worldbuilding caught my attention, it was easy to follow and the pacing was nice as well. As I continued reading, it turned out to be a dark setting with plenty of ways for things to go bad. Stories being short helped me tolerate the violence and I was enjoying the worldbuilding, magic system and characters. The stories were set in different parts of the world and there were interesting non-human POV characters too.<hr><h3 id=2-set-in-asia><p style="color: #a0494c">2.

There is a self-contained main plot, but this book is very much a transitional one too. The end game has started and we got plenty of exciting hints. This was also the darkest book of the series so far.<hr><h3 id=3-a-selection-from-the-r-fantasy-a-to-z-genre-guide><p style="color: #a0494c">3.

The novel certainly has plenty of hilarious moments, but I wasn't prepared for the violence. I liked the art, especially the attention to minor details that became relevant soon after. I revisited a few sequences to fully appreciate the brilliance. The setting was odd (medieval and futuristic mix), disorienting at first but grew on me as the novel progressed.<hr><h3 id=4-found-family><p style="color: #a0494c">4.

It also helped that there was only one POV, though I wished for more POVs by the end of the book. I started reading on Friday evening, assuming I'll finish by Sunday. I ended up working about an hour and finished book 2 by Sunday evening. I loved the alien setting and I feel that the author did a good job of presenting the various races and the cultural aspects.<hr><h3 id=5-first-person-pov><p style="color: #a0494c">5.

It didn't help that the setting was shrouded in mystery. The book was short and paced fast enough that the ending seemed to be missing half a book. I'm hoping that a re-read will provide a better experience, somewhat like <em>Interstellar</em> which I enjoyed and understood better the second time around. Speaking of movies, I had a strong urge to watch <em>Cast Away</em> again after finishing Piranesi.<hr><h2 id=second-row><p style="color: #7e0b5f">Second row<a class=zola-anchor href=#second-row aria-label="Anchor link for: second-row">ðŸ”—</a></h2><h3 id=6-book-club-or-readalong-book><p style="color: #a0494c">6.

Jainan was too stiff for most of the book. Their relationship was awkward for the most part as well, which was sort of expected given the events, but it made for a slow read for me. The pacing did pick up a few times and I liked the ending. My predictions regarding the mystery were way off, but these days I tend to not put too much effort and just let the author lead me towards the reveal.<ul><li><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/q6njub/hea_book_club_winters_orbit_midway_discussion/>HEA Book Club: Winter's Orbit Midway Discussion</a><li><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/qg76kt/hea_book_club_winters_orbit_final_discussion/>HEA Book Club: Winter's Orbit Final Discussion</a></ul><hr><h3 id=7-new-to-you-author><p style="color: #a0494c">7.

Rubin (4/5)<p>I wasn't feeling well (bit of a stomach trouble) and I remembered that this novel was supposed to be a light-hearted fun. And it was indeed fun and filled with humor that had me clutching my stomach in pain from laughing every page. I especially enjoyed the slice-of-life feel in the first half of the novel. Some characters stood out right from the start and some grew to be likeable as the events progressed. The pacing was steady to start with, became more faster paced when action started. Another plus point I'd say was the foreshadowing, especially those that played out humorously in multiple scenes. Even the chapter titles played a role!<hr><h3 id=8-sub-slice-of-life-small-scale-fantasy><p style="color: #a0494c">8.

Roger stole the show as the main character and his interactions with the wizard were enjoyable right from the start. The way these two worked with side characters was a delight to read. I felt like the author's real life competency was imparted on these characters. The fantasy aspects were muted compared to Roger's efforts to grow into his role as a butler.<p><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/b83fs8/here_it_is_the_rfantasy_2019_book_bingo_challenge/>Sub used from 2019 bingo</a><hr><h3 id=9-backlist-book><p style="color: #a0494c">9.

The setting was interesting (a phase shifted Earth with similar but changed political history). Economics plays a major role in progression of the characters. Rick struggles to stay afloat while taking care of his sister. Their relationship was one of the best highlights throughout the series. Rick finds himself participating in combat events. For once, the tournament arc didn't have a sudden disturbance leading to escalation of events. The book ended well and can be read as a standalone too.<hr><h3 id=10-revenge-seeking-character><p style="color: #a0494c">10.

Having highly competent main characters helped too, which seems like a frequently occurring theme in Janny's books. I found the magic system interesting as well, playing a big role in driving the plot forward. The book was a bit too dark for me though.<hr><h2 id=third-row><p style="color: #7e0b5f">Third row<a class=zola-anchor href=#third-row aria-label="Anchor link for: third-row">ðŸ”—</a></h2><h3 id=11-mystery-plot><p style="color: #a0494c">11.

Instead of whodunnit, events were revealed little by little as two teens and their friends/relatives try to research and collect evidence. That was nice by itself but what I liked most was the setting, ghostly interactions, Elatsoe's indigenous history and stories passed through generations. The illustrations at the start of chapters were good too.<hr><h3 id=12-comfort-read><p style="color: #a0494c">12.

The book was fast paced, which helped a lot. I started reading in the afternoon and midway through the book I realized I just had to finish it before sleeping. I don't have a particular craving for chocolate but I did wish for some while reading (made worse since I couldn't have gone out to buy due to lockdown). The author did a great job of moving the story forward and mixing it with character growth. Oh, and the illustrations were nice too!<hr><h3 id=13-published-in-2021><p style="color: #a0494c">13.

Valentine (4/5)<p>It took me a few chapters to get going and then it was fast paced enough for me to keep wanting to turn the pages. I laughed out loud a few times and the power progression was as absurd as the quest. Some of the twists were pleasantly surprising, but I wasn't really paying much attention to the details. Overall, I had fun reading the book most of the time. I would've probably binged the two sequels, but the book took a more serious turn towards the end, so I'll check them out some other time.<hr><h3 id=14-cat-squasher-500-pages><p style="color: #a0494c">14.

Despite the sprawling epic setting, the main focus is Scorio's journey. Right from the first chapter when Scorio is reborn (along with many others), he faces a series of challenges and setbacks. Along the way he gets help from other characters, learns about the world, political structure and his own magical abilities. All of these flowed well with the fast paced plot, with Scorio's strong determination shining bright. Some of his gambits were incredible, but the author handled it well with the consequences. The tone was dark and serious, with a handful of lighter moments providing breathing space.<hr><h3 id=15-sff-related-nonfiction><p style="color: #a0494c">15.

I would've subbed this square, but I had trouble with three squares! <em>Worldbuilding For Fantasy Fans And Authors</em> was on Kindle Unlimited, so I gave it a try. Took me multiple sittings spread over more than a week to finish, but I'm proud that I did it! Difficult to rate the book based on my enjoyment. However, I can definitely recommend this book to those who are interested in worldbuilding strategies. I particularly liked the examples from popular works and the illustrations were nicely done too.<hr><h2 id=fourth-row><p style="color: #7e0b5f">Fourth row<a class=zola-anchor href=#fourth-row aria-label="Anchor link for: fourth-row">ðŸ”—</a></h2><h3 id=16-latinx-or-latin-american-author><p style="color: #a0494c">16.

I'm not yet tired of orphan tropes and I love eccentric authority characters, so you could say this book was a good fit for me. I'd have loved it even more if the other POV characters and their abilities were more fleshed out (which the sequel did well). Pacing was good for the most part, helped by mysteries about the magic system, characters, etc. The eccentric character's chapters often had me laughing despite the serious setting.<hr><h3 id=17-self-published><p style="color: #a0494c">17.

The tournament arc picked up from where it ended in the second book and continued to provide entertaining setting and matches. It was good to have parts of the overarching plot take greater significance in this book. <em>Soulbrand</em> was a much needed savior for me after a reading slump and DNF books.<hr><h3 id=18-forest-setting><p style="color: #a0494c">18.

Overall, I liked it but I wouldn't be reading the sequels since it was much too dark for me. The cover image helped me a lot with the visualization of the forest setting. I loved how the author went about describing the details and mixed the plot elements. Academy setting is one of my favorite tropes, which was another reason I managed to finish the book.<hr><h3 id=19-genre-mashup><p style="color: #a0494c">19.

Watt (4/5)<p>Overall, I enjoyed this mystery fantasy <em>aided</em> by dragons. Said dragons are pet sized and I loved the snippets of their history and current relationship with some of the humans. The pacing picked up in the second half, but I didn't mind the slower start as the main characters were all interesting in their own ways. I wasn't expecting big twists given the blurb. I'd say it was interesting enough and worked well as the book is marketed as "funny cozy mystery".<hr><h3 id=20-has-chapter-titles><p style="color: #a0494c">20.

Riddle (4/5)<p><em>Spit and Song</em> starts with Kali's story, which I was immediately drawn to. Just as well, because I might've quit if it had started with Puk's story (I usually avoid books with drug addict MCs). The writing is easy to follow and I enjoyed the sedate pace and interesting world building. One of the best things I like about Riddle's books is that the setting has various kinds of sentient beings and it is a welcoming place for all kinds of identity and orientation. The <em>illicit job opportunity</em> mentioned in the blurb turned out to be a funny, adventurous and horrifying experience for the characters. Along the way, the ill-suited pair come to rely upon each other and rediscover themselves. Special mention for Bella, their trustworthy mount, who definitely earns a spot on the book cover.<hr><h2 id=fifth-row><p style="color: #7e0b5f">Fifth row<a class=zola-anchor href=#fifth-row aria-label="Anchor link for: fifth-row">ðŸ”—</a></h2><h3 id=21-title-of><p style="color: #a0494c">21.

Small scale conflict. Baked goodness. A perfect recipe for a comfort read in troubling times. Leo's tantrums didn't make a good first impression for me (especially since it resulted in food wastage). As I got used to the family members, the bakery and the school setting, I started enjoying the book more. I was lazy to look up all the Spanish terms sprinkled throughout the book. Enough context was there to get a basic understanding, but I guess someone familiar would've enjoyed them better. The school day after the cookie disaster had me laughing out loud.<hr><h3 id=22-first-contact><p style="color: #a0494c">22.

Even though I skimmed over many of those portions in this book, I still enjoyed the rest that I could understand without having to think too much. And there were quite a few nuggets that I could relate to as a programmer, for example:<blockquote><p>The hardest part ... is constantly having to come up with names for stuff.</blockquote><p>The pacing was good throughout. The ending was great but I wish it was longer. I felt that the flashbacks were aptly placed most of the time and moved the plot along nicely.<hr><h3 id=23-trans-or-nonbinary-character><p style="color: #a0494c">23.

The author did a good job of moving the story alongside these two threads. Apart from Danielle, I liked a couple of side characters. A lot of the established superheroes fell flat for me though. Utopia wasn't that interesting as a villain either, but I got the feeling that some of the events would become relevant for the sequels.<hr><h3 id=24-debut-author><p style="color: #a0494c">24.

Characters shone through this very enjoyable slice-of-life book. The pacing and writing were good, it felt like the work of an experienced writer instead of a debut. About halfway through, I was a bit disappointed about a magical device feeling like deus ex machina, but turns out that was part of the main plot and it was more than satisfying to see the direction author went with it. All the chapters had a nice illustration at the start too!<hr><h3 id=25-witches><p style="color: #a0494c">25.

The pacing was relentless from the very start. A few times I wondered if I had accidentally missed the first book or perhaps a prequel series. I liked the magic system and how it was applied during the events of this book. I'd have enjoyed more if the lead pair's prior shenanigans and training were shown (perhaps as flashbacks). Their dynamic was good, but the past events which led them to rely upon each other are mostly just described. The ending was good and left a lot of threads open for future books.</div></article></div><div class="column is-2 is-hidden-mobile"><aside class=menu style="position: sticky; top: 48px"><p class="heading has-text-weight-bold">Contents<ul class=menu-list><li><a id=link-first-row class="toc is-size-7 is-active"href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/lists/fantasy-bingo-card-2021/#first-row> First row </a> <ul><li><a id=link-1-five-sff-short-stories class="toc is-size-7"href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/lists/fantasy-bingo-card-2021/#1-five-sff-short-stories> 1.
