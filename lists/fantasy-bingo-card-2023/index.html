The idea is to expand your reading by filling 5-25 squares. Each square has an easy mode and a hard mode with additional restrictions.

Title with a Title</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199233025-loremaster>Loremaster</a> by M.E. Robinson (4/5) <em>(HM)</em><p>The author did a great job of describing the street life and how it shaped Rowan as a person. We get glimpses of his past throughout the novel, which came in handy during a couple of tricky situations.<p>There were action scenes that reminded you of the dangers of adventuring, politics, etc. There were even deaths that were a bit too dark for my liking. However, they were largely offset by magical training and cozy slice-of-life scenes. Some might find the pacing slow as a result, but I found it a compelling read and finished this rather long book in about a day.<hr><h3 id=2-superheroes>2. Superheroes</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/178798504-silvers>Silvers</a> by Brian J. Nordon (5/5) <em>(HM)</em><p>This book had a nice blend of magical studies and slice-of-life scenes. There's a bit of action as well towards the end. I especially enjoyed the crafting sessions. The author did a great job of bringing together the Heros who needed the magical items, guild politics, support staff, teachers and Sal (main character) using his unique powers.<p>Sal had a really overpowered magical ability â€” I thought he (and other such OP students) would've been pulled from the academy and fast tracked to work as much as possible against the demons. That said, only a month passed in this book and the already established safe zones are perhaps good enough to not require desperate attempts. It didn't really feel like there was an apocalypse going on. I don't mind though â€” it made for a very enjoyable lighthearted read.<hr><h3 id=3-bottom-of-the-tbr>3. Bottom of the TBR</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/531792.Shards_of_Honor>Shards of Honor</a> by Lois McMaster Bujold (4/5) <em>(HM)</em><p>I enjoyed the first half of the book more than the second half. An alien planet with fascinating flora and fauna. The two main characters having to survive a long trip on foot in a dangerous environment, while caring for a heavily injured person. The twists and an almost comical case of misunderstandings in a very serious situation. What followed wasn't as enticing as I expected. Lot more focus on politics, deadly maneuvers and trigger events that almost had me DNFing.<hr><h3 id=4-magical-realism-or-literary-fantasy>4. Magical Realism or Literary Fantasy</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/143424506-druid-s-oak-farm>Druid's Oak Farm</a> by Susanna Scott (4/5) <em>(HM)</em><p>This was a short and sweet cozy novel, with a bit of magical realism thrown in. Characters (including the dog) were the main highlight, even though we didn't get much in terms of depth given the short nature of the book. Writing was easy to follow, though descriptions got a bit tedious to focus on.<p>The main plot was about saving the retreat (for artists and the like). Among other things, we got interesting anecdotes about druids mixed with historical events. And some romantic sub-plots too. Overall, a pleasing comfort read.<hr><h3 id=5-young-adult>5. Young Adult</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47525.The_Magicians_of_Caprona>The Magicians of Caprona</a> by Diana Wynne Jones (4/5)<p>The first half seemed all over the place with too many characters and there didn't seem much to the plot. Things picked up in the second half and a lot of the stuff from the first half made better sense. I enjoyed the ending. Overall, the book had the usual charm of the author's whimsical take on magic but takes a while to get used to the characters.<hr><h2 id=second-row>Second row</h2><h3 id=6-mundane-jobs>6. Mundane Jobs</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46163953-a-coup-of-tea>A Coup of Tea</a> by Casey Blair (5/5) <em>(HM)</em><p>This was a delightful read. There really wasn't much in terms of action, but the pacing was great throughout thanks to a good plot with a bit of mystery and skillfully crafted tension between characters. The different ways of performing magic were intriguing and played a significant role in the plot even though we don't get much in terms of details. I especially liked that magecraft could be learned as a skill and yet had a neat restriction.<p>The tea ceremony was very interesting. Initially, I found it a bit hard to believe the kind of training tea masters had to go through until I got a better sense of what they did (hint: it's not just about concocting tea). Overall, despite the higher stakes and emotional stuff, this was a heartwarming read.<hr><h3 id=7-published-in-the-00s>7. Published in the 00s</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/991723.The_Lost_Steersman>The Lost Steersman</a> by Rosemary Kirstein (4/5) <em>(HM)</em><p>I liked this similar to the first two books in the series. The big reveal at the end was great. And now I feel like I know why the second book was more focused on the tribes as well as their warring nature. I had plenty of questions after reaching the end. Will need to re-read the earlier books to catch things I missed.<p><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/the-steerswoman/>Full review of the series</a><hr><h3 id=8-angels-and-demons>8. Angels and Demons</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123245772-small-miracles>Small Miracles</a> by Olivia Atwater (4/5) <em>(HM)</em><p>This was a delightful read, filled with small moments that nonetheless have a big impact on the characters. Gadriel, a fallen angel, is given the task of tempting Holly (a highly virtuous character) just a little bit. One thing leads to another and suddenly there are many more characters connected to this seemingly simple saga and Gadriel has to dig deep to deliver. And along the way, perhaps Gadriel needed uplifting as much as the other characters ;)<p>The footnotes were charming too!<hr><h3 id=9-five-sff-short-stories>9. Five SFF Short Stories</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/202081126-the-gorgon-incident-and-other-stories>The Gorgon Incident and Other Stories</a> by John Bierce (5/5) <em>(HM)</em><p>Mage Errant is one of my favorite magical academy books and this collection of short stories was a great addition to this amazing setting. We got to meet several side characters from the main series, as well as past stories, origin of named weapons, visit other continents, etc. Some of my favorites include:<ul><li>The Wanderer<li>Test of Magic<li>Old Setah and the River (wouldn't mind a novella/novel with Setah as the MC)<li>Counterfeit<li>The Gorgon Incident<li>Mudflat Nights (mostly for the worldbuilding and pepper vs glass magic fight)<li>Luthe of Clan Castis</ul><hr><h3 id=10-novel-featuring-a-library>10.

Lee (4/5)<p>It took me until 25% of the first book to get used to the narration style and the setting. Once I got halfway through the first book, I pretty much binge read the rest of the trilogy in less than five days.<p>I especially liked the main character and his adventurous team. They meet by chance across multiple events that were connected by the overarching plot. And they all have some unfinished business that'd hopefully get addressed in the sequels. It was nice to see their bond grow close as they tackled the time-loop (especially in the third book). Many side-characters were interesting as well, so I'd say character work was a strong point for the series.<hr><h2 id=third-row>Third row</h2><h3 id=11-self-published-or-indie-publisher>11. Self-Published OR Indie Publisher</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/181948465-card-mage>Card Mage</a> by Benedict Patrick (4/5)<p>This was a compelling read right from the start. A gripping dark tale, set in a world with magical cards that were used both as high stakes entertainment and real world magical feats. Naturally, they played a big role in the economy. The story was told from main character's POV, and we get worldbuilding in the form of epigraphs as well.<p>There were plenty of twists and nasty surprises to keep you hooked. The writing was easy to follow. I don't have any experience with such playing cards, but I could still follow the story easily. I found it difficult to keep track of all the rules and the variety of cards, but you get enough context during the games.<hr><h3 id=12-set-in-the-middle-east-middle-eastern-sff>12. Set in the Middle East/Middle Eastern SFF</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58950705-the-stardust-thief>The Stardust Thief</a> by Chelsea Abdullah (3/5) <em>(HM)</em><p>The starting few chapters were great, especially the worldbuilding and characters that might prove to be interesting later on. However, around the time the quest was forced upon the party, I was losing interest. Too much of emotional drama, betrayals and deaths. I liked the concept of magic/relics/etc and loved some of the storytelling scenes, but overall it was too dark for me. I only finished it for the bingo.<hr><h3 id=13-published-in-2023>13. Published in 2023</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199338639-antimage>Antimage</a> by Alexander Olson (4/5) <em>(HM)</em><p>The premise was very interesting â€” an archmage plucking a scientist from Earth so as to exploit modern technology for their fantasy world (Davrar). Only, the archmage and their entire culture turns out to be evil. Somehow, the main character (Nathan) escapes, with a bit of help from the System, his own science background and an adventure team (who were opposing the evil empire). Rest of the book was about Nathan learning to be an adventurer and making use of his knowledge from Earth.<p>The world of Davrar was pretty interesting, even though there were plenty of mysteries left uncovered in this book. The plot was good in the first half, meandered a lot in the second half and ended strongly. Apart from Nathan, many of the side characters were interesting too, especially the adventure team who rescued him and the team he joined for training. I enjoyed the second book more, especially the frenetic ending.<hr><h3 id=14-multiverse-and-alternate-realities>14. Multiverse and Alternate Realities</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61397047-waybound>Waybound</a> by Will Wight (5/5) <em>(HM)</em><p>What a journey! I started Cradle after the release of the fifth book (Ghostwater) and since then I've always started the newest book on the release day. One of the best ever series I've had the pleasure to discover, thanks to the many gushing reviews I saw on the r/fantasy sub.<p>Progression fantasy in general is my favorite subgenre at the moment. Characters, worldbuilding, the magic system, high-stakes action scenes and humor made Cradle special for me. Despite the epic scale, it is a <em>fun</em> read, unlike what you usually see in (grim)dark works. Perfect for the escapism I crave. And it has great reread value, especially after the reveals in books 8 and 10. I did a full reread in preparation for the final.<p><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/waybound/>Full spoiler review</a><hr><h3 id=15-poc-author>15. POC Author</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75517360-tree-of-aeons>Tree of Aeons</a> by Spaizzzer (4/5)<p>The main plot was a recurring invasion of demons, who were then defeated by heroes summoned from Earth. The local people also participate in large numbers, but aren't powerful enough to defeat the demons on their own. The main character is from Earth as well, but he ends up as a tree instead.<p>The short nature of chapters in the first book (sometimes just a line or two!) were a frustrating experience, despite the intriguing plot. They eventually gained more depth and events became more interesting too. The first four books have spanned hundreds of years, and thus many chapters summarize things. Still, I found them an enjoyable read, especially the research stuff and kingdom expansion â€” only wish it wasn't darker than I'm comfortable with. I thought about DNFing after the end of the second book, but somehow kept reading and the pay off in the third book was great.<hr><h2 id=fourth-row>Fourth row</h2><h3 id=16-book-club-or-readalong-book>16. Book Club OR Readalong Book</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60288155-portal-to-nova-roma>Portal to Nova Roma</a> by J.R. Mathews (4/5)<p>The pacing was frenetic â€” you'd be hard pressed to find a chapter without action. The writing was easy to follow and if you find the first quarter of the book to your liking, you'll find it very difficult to stop reading. I certainly wish there had been some slower paced slice-of-life chapters (there were a few scenes, but the details I cherish were largely time-skipped). And POVs from some of the side characters would've been welcome too. The worldbuilding was good, with many pleasantly surprising details revealed as the plot progressed.<p>The two sequels released so far (with two more expected) were good as well. Overall, I'd highly recommend the series for those who enjoy progression fantasy.<hr><h3 id=17-novella>17. Novella</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64406927-dragon-forged>Dragon Forged</a> by Nerine Dorman (4/5) <em>(HM)</em><p>This was a well written novella about two dwarf friends going on an adventure to save their village from a dragon. I especially liked how the author wove events from their daily lives into the plot. I would've enjoyed a longer novel, especially to see how they continued their crafts, may be another adventure or two, visiting places of interest, etc.<hr><h3 id=18-mythical-beasts>18. Mythical Beasts</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/202787790-the-pale-blade>The Pale Blade</a> by Alec Hutson (4/5)<p>The characters and worldbuilding were the major strengths of this book. There's a rich history of empires and ruins that intertwine with the current day events. Of magical weapons, spirits, otherworldly beings, shifty magicians and dragon bonds. All of this unfolds within a classical fantasy trope â€” Bren, a young woman brought up by farmers, goes on an adventure after her kingdom was invaded. Along the way, she meets interesting characters, gains mysterious weapons and was drawn into events beyond her control. And of course, things aren't always black and white as it seemed at the start.<p>The pacing was good for the most part. Something interesting kept happening to move the plot forward amidst the worldbuilding. Things slowed a bit in the second half, but picked up well towards the end. Plenty of twists too â€” looking forward to how they play out in the sequels.<hr><h3 id=19-elemental-magic>19. Elemental Magic</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61753288-can-t-spell-treason-without-tea>Can't Spell Treason Without Tea</a> by Rebecca Thorne (4/5) <em>(HM)</em><p>Writing was easy to follow and the pacing was good throughout. The main characters were easy to root for given their goal of opening a shop in a remote place. The side characters from the town were nice as well (some took a while), but I wish they had a lot more screen time. That would've lent a more cozy feeling. I loved the griffon companion and hope there's more of them in the sequels.<hr><h3 id=20-myths-and-retellings>20. Myths and Retellings</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41423.The_Outlaws_of_Sherwood>The Outlaws of Sherwood</a> by Robin McKinley (4/5) <em>(HM)</em><p>Been a long long time since I read a Robin Hood book â€” one retelling I had read some months back wasn't close to what I vaguely remembered about the book I reread multiple times as a kid. The first meeting between Robin and John in "The Outlaws of Sherwood" was one of the scenes I still had good impression of â€” particularly that it was a staff fight and someone fell in the river.<p>Overall, this book was an enjoyable read. I especially liked that Robin wasn't the main focus â€” many of the merry men got their own scene/story to shine. The ending felt a bit weird though.<hr><h2 id=fifth-row>Fifth row</h2><h3 id=21-queernorm-setting>21. Queernorm Setting</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65213543-bookshops-bonedust>Bookshops & Bonedust</a> by Travis Baldree (4/5) <em>(HM)</em><p>I feel most people who enjoyed "Legends & Lattes" would like this one too. Viv was younger and brash, but that just added to the charm and her kinder nature was still present. We get to see how Viv met one of her adventure team member as well as an item that was a pleasant surprise (wasn't expecting it to show up).<p>I especially liked the tidbits about bookshops and authors. The tiny illustrations at the start of the chapters were nicely done. The epilogue got my hopes high that we'd see a L&L sequel :)<hr><h3 id=22-coastal-or-island-setting>22. Coastal or Island Setting</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195882608-whispers-from-the-poisoned-isle>Whispers from the Poisoned Isle</a> by Travis M. Riddle (4/5)<p>The starting few chapters were a bit tough to read due to the horrors of the plagued island. I resorted to skimming the nastier descriptions. Other than that, this was another good addition to the Jekua series. It was good to see the banter and slice-of-life scenes continuing alongside training and action. I especially liked the team work in handling the fights. We got answers to some of the mysteries built up from the first book and the ending promised more exciting stuff to come.<hr><h3 id=23-druids>23. Druids</h3><p><a href=https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/68386/hunting-and-herbalism>Hunting and Herbalism</a> by Synonymoose (4/5) <em>(HM)</em><p>What I liked most was the main character being a Druid, with a cool set of powers that developed well as she leveled up. The opening few chapters had the standard tropes of a human from Earth being isekai-ed to a fantasy world. After the short survival phase, it was great to see goblin-like creatures actually helping out the main character instead of being a fodder for leveling up. Their culture was intriguing too.<p>Many of the side-characters were memorable and it was nice to see them having their own aspirations and stuff. I love books with magical beast bonds and the one we got in this series was amazing! The first book was almost cozy at times â€” until events started going haywire as the climax phase started. Some of the developments were darker than I was comfortable with.<p>And it ended on a cliffhanger! So of course, I <em>had</em> to continue with the second book. This one was the best among the first three books, which sort of completes an arc. The worldbuilding was cool, the survival-type plot and power-ups felt organic and well thought out. The writing improved as the series progressed.<hr><h3 id=24-featuring-robots>24. Featuring Robots</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195602507-father-of-constructs>Father of Constructs</a> by Aaron Renfroe (4/5)<p>After the starting few chapters set up the plot, it was an enjoyable read and the pacing was good as well. The Janitor's good nature, past problems and an easy going attitude despite his old age makes you feel as if he earned his legendary class instead of getting lucky. Add a bunch of well meaning side characters coming to his aid and a wonderful robot character, and you get a heartwarming experience. Given the epic nature of the plot, there were fights and villainous characters as well, but overall this book was a lighthearted read. The stat sheets were a bit too dense for me to parse, but thankfully most of the details could be skimmed.<p>Thumbs-up from me (you'll understand the reference after reading the book).<hr><h3 id=25-sequel>25. Sequel</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123321483-scion-of-storms>Scion of Storms</a> by Samuel Hinton (5/5)<p>This was a fantastic follow up to "Soul Relic". The main focus was on training, advancing and the tournament. As with the first book, there were plenty of slice-of-life scenes. I especially enjoyed the scenes featuring the misfits group and their banter. I was initially a bit disappointed that their group training was rarely described in detail. Seeing them in action in the actual tournament helped fill in the missing details. Nasdin hall scenes then became one of my favorite parts. And after the first round, there were a few training sessions shown anyway.<p><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/scion-of-storms/>Full spoiler review</a></div><div class=post-footer><div class=post-tags><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/2023/>#2023</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/bingo-card/>#bingo-card</a></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><p>ðŸ“° Use <a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/rss.xml>this link</a> for the RSS feed. <br> âœ… Follow me on <a href=https://twitter.com/learn_byexample>Twitter</a>, <a href=https://github.com/learnbyexample>GitHub</a> and <a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/learnbyexample42>Youtube</a> for interesting tech nuggets. <br> ðŸ“§ Subscribe to <a href=https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/learnbyexample-weekly>learnbyexample weekly</a> for programming resources, tips, tools, free ebooks and more (free newsletter, delivered every Friday).<hr color=#e6e6e6></div></article></div></main></div><script src=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/even.js></script>
