Rubin</a>'s debut novel. This can be read as a standalone, with sequels likely to come.</p><span id=continue-reading></span><p align=center><img alt="Dim Stars book cover" src=/escapist-reviews/images/book_covers/dim_stars.jpg><h2 id=blurb>Blurb</h2><blockquote><p>Kenzie Washington, fourteen-year-old girl genius, signs up for a two-week tour as a cadet on the spaceship of her idol, Captain Dash Drake. Too bad Dash, who once saved the galaxy from the evil Forgers, is a broke loser and much less than meets the eye.<p>But when an intergalactic evil appears and launches an attack, Dash, Kenzie, and the shipâ€™s crew escape, making them the next target. On the run and low on gas, Dash and Kenzie encounter cannibal space-pirates, catastrophic equipment failure, and a cyborg whoâ€™s kind of a jerk.<p>Kenzie is determined to discover the bad guysâ€™ secret plan. But for her to succeed, Dash needs to keep his brilliant, annoying cadet from getting killed â€¦which is a lot harder than it sounds.</blockquote><h2 id=review>Review</h2><p>I wasn't feeling well (bit of a stomach trouble) and I remembered that this novel was supposed to be a light-hearted fun. And it was indeed fun and filled with humor that had me clutching my stomach in pain from laughing every page.<p>I especially enjoyed the slice-of-life feel in the first half of the novel. Some characters stood out right from the start and some grew to be likeable as the events progressed.<p>Humor is hit or miss with me, I enjoyed most of them while a few were a bit uncomfortable for me (but I could still appreciate how it'd be funny for some). Kept imagining how the dialogues would pan out as a live-action movie, thought it would be great and it helped me feel more immersed while reading too.<p>The pacing was steady to start with, became more faster paced when action started. While I liked the second half, I would've enjoyed more if the novel had stayed as low-stakes. Guess I should start reading the blurbs before starting a book to avoid misplaced expectations.<p>Another plus point I'd say was the foreshadowing, especially those that played out humorously in multiple scenes. Even the chapter titles played a role!<p>Excited to see how the sequels will play out.<p><em>My rating:</em> ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸâ˜†<h3 id=what-others-are-saying>What others are saying</h3><p>From <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4045657225>Nicholas Eames's review on goodreads</a>:<blockquote><p>This book is so good. It's hilarious--I laughed out loud countless times while reading it. It's fast-paced in the best way possible--the end of every chapter pretty much compels you to start reading the next. It's got a ton of really genuine heartfelt moments, and characters (so many characters) that are so endearing.</blockquote><p>From <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4286623729>Anj's review on goodreads</a>:<blockquote><p>It has witty banters, actions, and has me laughing until the end. The characters are well-rounded and wonderful. The banters between them flowed naturally and always delightful. The world-build is well-inagined and the pacing is good. It was fun seeing the plot unfold!</blockquote><h2 id=bingo>Bingo</h2><p><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/mhz2tt/official_rfantasy_2021_book_bingo_challenge/>/r/Fantasy/ 2021 bingo categories</a>:<ul><li>New to You Author<li>Comfort Read (HM)<li>Self-Published<li>Has Chapter Titles<li>Debut Author</ul></div><div class=post-footer><div class=post-tags><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/science-fiction/>#science-fiction</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/self-published/>#self-published</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/comfort-read/>#comfort-read</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/humor/>#humor</a></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><div class=post-nav><p><a class=previous href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/heaven-fall/>â€¹ Heaven Fall: engaging mix of epic and progression fantasy</a><br><p><a class=next href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tales-from-ruun/>Tales from Ruun: fantasy short story collection â€º</a><br></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><p>ðŸ“° Use <a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/rss.xml>this link</a> for the RSS feed. <br> âœ… Follow me on <a href=https://twitter.com/learn_byexample>Twitter</a>, <a href=https://github.com/learnbyexample>GitHub</a> and <a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/learnbyexample42>Youtube</a> for interesting tech nuggets. <br> ðŸ“§ Subscribe to <a href=https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/learnbyexample-weekly>learnbyexample weekly</a> for programming resources, tips, tools, free ebooks and more (free newsletter, delivered every Friday).<hr color=#e6e6e6></div></article></div></main></div><script src=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/even.js></script>
