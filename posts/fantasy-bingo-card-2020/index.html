The idea is to expand your reading by filling 5-25 squares. Each square has an easy mode and a hard mode with additional restrictions. Since I average more than one book a week, I felt I could easily do one <strong>Hard mode</strong> card and perhaps do a few more cards later. In the end, I struggled to finish a single HM card.<p>I also added another self-imposed rule that any author I've already read prior to the start of the bingo cannot be used for this card. That made it tougher to fill the squares. In retrospect, I should've kept this rule but chosen easy mode. I don't plan to do HM next time, but perhaps I'll keep the tradition of picking a self-imposed rule.</p><span id=continue-reading></span><hr><h2 id=first-row><p style="color: #7e0b5f">First row<a class=zola-anchor href=#first-row aria-label="Anchor link for: first-row">ðŸ”—</a></h2><h3 id=1-novel-translated-from-its-original-language><p style="color: #a0494c">1.

I've seen a few anime/movies and read east Asian inspired books before, but this was quite different from them. Overall, I liked the book, probably because I wasn't expecting things to be similar to what I'm used to. In fact, things did seem familiar at the start, but then events kept changing from the well worn path that you are better off avoiding any prediction. I'd recommend this for its strengths - mythology, setting and interesting characters.<hr><h3 id=2-setting-featuring-snow-ice-or-cold><p style="color: #a0494c">2.

Shea<p>I enjoyed this more than what I expected from the blurb. Special points for the writing, which was a little unique in the way of description, dialogues, etc that I found it refreshing. The pacing was good, kept me turning pages. The characters were nicely done as well. If I had to find something to complain, I'd say that the enemy didn't adapt much despite the prior encounters.<hr><h3 id=3-optimistic-sff><p style="color: #a0494c">3.

I didn't expect the climax to have such a big explosion, but it did help end the novel nicely. I'll be checking out other books from the author for sure. Hope they are as good as Sourdough, especially interesting characters.<hr><h3 id=4-novel-featuring-necromancy><p style="color: #a0494c">4.

This was mostly a hit even though I didn't get all the cultural references. The ending left me a bit confused and in a bad taste. Mulling it over afterwards, I felt like may be things will be clarified in sequels or perhaps I didn't fully understand the ending. Either way, I'll still recommend this book.<hr><h3 id=5-ace-aro-spec-fic><p style="color: #a0494c">5.

But the main plot is quite dark in its content. I think I'd have liked it better if the slice-of-life parts were more prominent and the plot was something simpler, or a small scale investigation instead of evil corporations exploiting people.<hr><h2 id=second-row><p style="color: #7e0b5f">Second row<a class=zola-anchor href=#second-row aria-label="Anchor link for: second-row">ðŸ”—</a></h2><h3 id=6-novel-featuring-a-ghost><p style="color: #a0494c">6.

Taylor<p>Enjoyed it. I liked that the tone was light hearted, which allowed me to enjoy the exploration stuff instead of fuming at all the politics and maniacs intent on destruction. It was a bit difficult to get invested with the characters/setting in the first half, but enjoyed the rest of the book.<hr><h3 id=8-climate-fiction><p style="color: #a0494c">8.

Magical smithing was the best portion that I liked. Fights were realistic.

It has most of the familiar tropes - getting stronger, MC is special through some quirk of fate, fights, sects/schools, buying and selling things related to weapons/cultivation, etc. The MC here doesn't hesitate to take decisive action for the most part, which I liked too.<p>The magic system is well thought out and divided into stages, with 10 advancements per stage. However, the details were a bit too much and I didn't try too hard to understand and remember them. There's an appendix chapter as well with details for those interested in that sort of stuff. The overly detailed description extended to MC's thinking and his experiences too. About halfway, I just started skimming such details.<p>The other major complaint for me was support characters and lack of lighter moments. There are other POVs and a few characters who do get some character development. But, the majority of the book is about the MC, his past, training, etc. There are hints that it can change in the next book and I hope that is the case.<hr><h3 id=10-any-r-fantasy-book-club-book-of-the-month-or-r-fantasy-read-along-book><p style="color: #a0494c">10.

Even the setting felt like 19th century. It sets a high bar of expectation. While the author does a good job of showing off Martin's detective skills, I would have enjoyed a less Sherlocky character.<p>That said, the world building was good and there are hints about more to come. The pacing was good at the start of the book, slowed a bit and then picked up again towards the end. Characters were well developed too (wish the housekeeper had been given some POV scenes).<hr><h3 id=12-novel-with-chapter-epigraphs><p style="color: #a0494c">12.

It was easy to read and pacing was good enough to keep going. The ending was nice as well. Having a kid among the team really worked for the story being told. However, the world lore got confusing with so many names, with some of them having multiple monikers. But I suppose if you are already familiar with Norse mythology, you might find it easier to understand and interesting as well.<hr><h3 id=13-novel-published-in-2020><p style="color: #a0494c">13.

The main focus is the mother-son duo (which reminded me a bit of The Sword of Kaigen). I liked their relationship, as well as Narune's two friends and the Sage who comes to help them often.<p>I'm quite bored of the eternal fight between creation and destruction (termed as stillness in this book) trope though. The spiritseer magic was quite interesting, but it was too difficult to understand and wasn't the focus of the novel. I'd have loved if there were POV among the other spiritseers and their training, relationships, etc. Too much talk about the stillness and the sense of dread they create lessens the enjoyment/escapism I wish to get from reading fantasy.<hr><h3 id=14-novel-set-in-a-school-or-university><p style="color: #a0494c">14.

Usually, I like lot of magical use, but the author does a nice job of incorporating fantasy-like (specifically progression fantasy) set up with physical combat skills. The pacing picked up about a quarter of a way into the book. The tone is serious for most of the book, so the few lighter moments stood out (wish there were lot more).<p>Character wise, there are two main POVs and I felt both characters were nicely done. I'd say secondary characters were also decently written, but lacked polish. Some scenes at the end felt abrupt to me (a character observes something, but that line of thought isn't followed up, an intense emotional scene is building up and then cuts off, etc) I would've liked more interaction, instead it is left to readers to fill the gaps.<hr><h3 id=15-sub-a-sff-novel-featuring-a-character-with-a-disability><p style="color: #a0494c">15.

I'd say the novel stands on its own - magic and politics blended nicely with a love story. The lead characters were both likeable, and the side characters were good too. The prose was easy to follow.

Thompson<p>Humor can be hit/miss with me, and I usually don't like the kind used often in this book, but they got a laugh out of me. The book is fast paced action, with one quest following right after the previous one finished, sometimes multiple quests on the same day. I'd have loved a bit more world building, character growth, etc but I don't think the author intends to go in that direction. Just a fast paced fun to read novel, ideal as a palate cleanser between epic fantasies.<hr><h3 id=17-five-sff-short-stories><p style="color: #a0494c">17.
