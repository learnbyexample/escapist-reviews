Doraâ€™s only goal for the London Season this year is to stay quiet and avoid upsetting her cousinâ€™s chances at a husbandâ€¦ but when the Lord Sorcier of England learns of her condition, she finds herself drawn ever more deeply into the tumultuous concerns of magicians and faeries.<p>Lord Elias Wilder is handsome, strange, and utterly uncouthâ€”but gossip says that he regularly performs three impossible things before breakfast, and he is willing to help Dora restore her missing half. If Doraâ€™s reputation can survive both her ongoing curse and her sudden connection with the least-liked man in all of high society, then she may yet reclaim her normal place in the worldâ€¦ but the longer Dora spends with Elias Wilder, the more she begins to suspect that one may indeed fall in love, even with only half a soul.<p><em>Pride and Prejudice</em> meets <em>Howlâ€™s Moving Castle</em> in this enthralling historical fantasy romance, where the only thing more meddlesome than faeries is a marriage-minded mama. Pick up <em>Half a Soul</em>, and be stolen away into debut author Olivia Atwaterâ€™s charming, magical version of Regency England!</blockquote><h2 id=review><p style="color: #7e0b5f">Review<a class=zola-anchor href=#review aria-label="Anchor link for: review">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>I have read romantic ðŸ’– fantasy before, but I do not typically look for such books to read. As part of the <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ft254j/official_rfantasy_2020_book_bingo_challenge/>/r/Fantasy/ bingo</a> challenge, I was looking to juggle my books around to avoid more than one novella in my card. So, when 'Half a Soul' came up as part of HEA club and had awesome reviews already, I picked it up. I ended up using the book for Canadian square though.<p>This was quite a lovely book. Finished it in less than a day. Characters, setting, plot, pacing - all of them combined well to give a delightful experience. The banter was awesome and felt natural.<p>The prologue didn't catch my attention much, but by the end of the first two chapters, I was turning pages in a hurry. Lot of secondary characters getting their due and focus was another aspect that I loved about this book. In hindsight, this was evident from the first chapter itself, and this continued to be such a refreshing feature that it left a big impression on me.<p><em>My rating:</em> ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ<h3 id=what-others-are-saying><p style="color: #a0494c">What others are saying<a class=zola-anchor href=#what-others-are-saying aria-label="Anchor link for: what-others-are-saying">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>From <a href=https://weatherwaxreport.blog/2020/08/04/half-a-soul-by-olivia-atwater/>Weatherwax Report blog</a>:<blockquote><p>I think the banter was probably one of the best parts of the book, the dialogue was witty, fast-moving, and believable. The writing style itself was light and breezy and made for easy listening. I found the narrator to be a great choice with a nice tone for the story and lightly done voices. The pacing was extremely quick despite the lack of action sequences and things of that nature. It was a quick book, coming in around 250 pages it took me just a few short reading sessions to finish it. I could have been done in one go if I had the time.</blockquote><p>From <a href=https://superstardrifter.com/2020/11/18/review-half-a-soul-by-olivia-atwater/>superstardrifter blog</a>:<blockquote><p>All told, I had a wonderful time with the whole thing, and I recommend it to anyone that likes a fantasy romance, a regency romance, or a fantasy of manners. This one combines pretty much all three of those things into one delightful package. I had 5/5 stars of a good time with this one! I canâ€™t wait to read the next story in the series!</blockquote><p>From <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/m0j2md/mini_reviews_half_a_soul_root_magic_midnight/>Dianthaa's review on /r/Fantasy/</a>:<blockquote><p>This was a HEA bookclub read and it was delightful. Short, sweet, funny, charming, everything I look for in a Romance novel, I couldnâ€™t put it down. The dynamic between the romantic leads is so fun and bantery, I couldnâ€™t get enough of them. I loved the way only having half a soul affected Dora, she was still sweet but very emotionally detached from everything. And of course, what made her awkward in society made her a perfect match for the love interest, cause she wasnâ€™t taking any of his bullshit. The book also featured faeries, which I always love. I liked how even though itâ€™s a fluffy romance, it didnâ€™t shy away from the harsh realities of the times, and how that was something that brought the main couple together. I was very happy with how the book tied up loose ends for the secondary characters too.</blockquote><h2 id=bingo><p style="color: #7e0b5f">Bingo<a class=zola-anchor href=#bingo aria-label="Anchor link for: bingo">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ft254j/official_rfantasy_2020_book_bingo_challenge/>/r/Fantasy/ 2020 bingo categories</a>:<ul><li>Optimistic SFF (HM)<li>Any r/fantasy Book Club Book of the Month OR r/fantasy Read-along Book <ul><li><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/liad8f/hea_book_club_half_a_soul_midway_discussion/>HEA Book Club: Half a Soul Midway Discussion</a><li><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/lt3vxh/hea_bookclub_half_a_soul_final_discussion/>HEA Bookclub: Half a Soul Final Discussion</a></ul><li>Self-Published SFF Novel<li>Novel Published in 2020 (HM)<li>A Book that Made You Laugh (HM)<li>Novel by a Canadian Author (HM)<li>Romantic Fantasy / Paranormal Romance</ul></div></article></div><div class="column is-2 is-hidden-mobile"><aside class=menu style="position: sticky; top: 48px"><p class="heading has-text-weight-bold">Contents<ul class=menu-list><li><a id=link-about class="toc is-size-7 is-active"href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/posts/half-a-soul/#about> About </a><li><a id=link-blurb class="toc is-size-7"href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/posts/half-a-soul/#blurb> Blurb </a><li><a id=link-review class="toc is-size-7"href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/posts/half-a-soul/#review> Review </a> <ul><li><a id=link-what-others-are-saying class="toc is-size-7"href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/posts/half-a-soul/#what-others-are-saying> What others are saying </a></ul><li><a id=link-bingo class="toc is-size-7"href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/posts/half-a-soul/#bingo> Bingo </a></ul></aside></div></div></div></section><section class=modal id=search-modal><div class=modal-background></div><div class=modal-content><div class=field><p class="control has-icons-right"><input class=input id=search placeholder="Search this website."type=search> <span class="icon is-small is-right"> <i class="fas fa-search"></i> </span></div><div class=search-results><div class=search-results__items></div></div></div><button aria-label=close class="modal-close is-large"></button></section><section class=section><div class=container><div class="columns is-centered"><div class="column is-8"><nav class=level><div class="level-item has-text-centered"><a class="button is-black is-outlined"href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/posts/fantasy-bingo-card-2020/> <span class="icon mr-2"> <i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-left"></i> </span> Mini-reviews for 2020 r/Fantasy hard mode bingo </a></div><div class="level-item has-text-centered"><a class="button is-black is-outlined"href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/posts/2020-favorite-fiction/> 10 favorite fictional books I read in 2020<span class="icon ml-2"> <i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> </span> </a></div></nav></div></div></div></section><footer class="py-4 has-background-light"><p class=has-text-centered>Built with <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-code fa-xs"></i> </span> code and <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-heart fa-xs"></i> </span> love <br> Powered By <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-power-off fa-xs"></i> </span> <a href=https://github.com/getzola/zola>Zola</a> (theme: <a href=https://www.getzola.org/themes/deepthought/>DeepThought</a>)</footer><script src=https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js></script><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/sharer.js@latest/sharer.min.js></script><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.6.1/galleria.min.js></script><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js></script><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.6.1/themes/folio/galleria.folio.min.js></script><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/elasticlunr/0.9.6/elasticlunr.min.js></script><script src=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/search_index.en.js></script><script src=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/js/site.js></script><script>
