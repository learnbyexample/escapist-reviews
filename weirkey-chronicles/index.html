For years he resented the betrayal that killed his friends, sent him back to Earth, and made him question everything he thought he knew.<p>But now, after a lifetime of struggle, he's found a way back to the Nine Worlds. An old man reborn in a new body, he has a second chance to rebuild what he lost and unravel a mystery that spans dimensions.</blockquote><h2 id=review>Review</h2><p><strong>Soulhome</strong><p>Just what I needed to start the new year! A fast paced progression fantasy with a pretty cool magic system.<p>Having already read two other series by Sarah Lin, I was excited to finally dig into the "Weirkey Chronicles" series. The premise and characters were interesting. I finished the book in less than a day.<p><strong>Rainhorn</strong><p>It was so nice to get more POVs in this book, and especially liked the introduction of the new companion (and the resulting hilarious scenes). The changed setting helped to add more worldbuilding details. I was pleasantly surprised with a few twists in this book.<p><strong>Archcrafter</strong><p>Again, enjoyed the new worlds. Plot continues to be mostly self-contained per book, with a few details being added to the overarching story. Nice to see improvements for all the main characters and Senka continues to be a mystery, yet hilarious whenever she shows up.<p><strong>Overall thoughts</strong><p>Sarah Lin continues to impress me with her variety of works, even though this series isn't as offbeat as "New Game Minus" and "Street Cultivation" (at least so far).<p>Best part of the series for me were the characters and the magic system. I liked the world building too, but it hasn't been that deep yet. In a way, that worked in my favor as I binged the three books in about 2.5 days. I just wanted an enjoyable, comfort read without having to think too much and this was a perfect fit. Especially after I had to DNF a book at 80% and marking another book to be read later after just one chapter.<p>Also, these infographics are super cool:<ul><li><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBrightestShadow/comments/k6vxt8/soulhome_architecture_101_with_theo_nauda_and_fiyu/>Soulhome Architecture 101</a><li><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBrightestShadow/comments/rdm9a5/soulhome_architecture_201_chamber_categories/>Soulhome Architecture 102: Chamber Categories</a><li><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBrightestShadow/comments/pma180/soulhome_architecture_201_ascension_with_theo/>Soulhome Architecture 201: Ascension</a></ul><p><em>My rating:</em> ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ<h3 id=what-others-are-saying>What others are saying</h3><p>From <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3967594690>Stephen Kruger's review on goodreads</a>:<blockquote><p>Interesting new magic system, characters that struggle and are complex. I particularly enjoy Sarah Lin's commitment to characters that have power, but are not indomitable. They have impact, but have to make difficult and meaningful decisions, they canâ€™t have everything.</blockquote><p>From <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3973786869>Kevin's review on goodreads</a>:<blockquote><p>A world traveling progression fantasy that uses the trappings of progression fantasy to look at the larger themes of literature, people from different universes trying to reach toward a meeting of the minds, to understand each other. Nonetheless, the progression plot is unique and absorbing.</blockquote></div><div class=post-footer><div class=post-tags><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/progression/>#progression</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/fantasy/>#fantasy</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/comfort-read/>#comfort-read</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/self-published/>#self-published</a></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><div class=post-nav><p><a class=previous href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/edict-of-honor/>â€¹ Edict of Honor: fantastic sequel</a><br><p><a class=next href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/six-mini-reviews-nov-dec-2021/>Six mini reviews â€º</a><br></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><p>ðŸ“° Use <a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/rss.xml>this link</a> for the RSS feed. <br> âœ… Follow me on <a href=https://twitter.com/learn_byexample>Twitter</a>, <a href=https://github.com/learnbyexample>GitHub</a> and <a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/learnbyexample42>Youtube</a> for interesting tech nuggets. <br> ðŸ“§ Subscribe to <a href=https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/learnbyexample-weekly>learnbyexample weekly</a> for programming resources, tips, tools, free ebooks and more (free newsletter, delivered every Friday).<hr color=#e6e6e6></div></article></div></main></div><script src=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/even.js></script>
