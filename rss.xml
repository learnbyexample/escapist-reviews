            <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first time I&#x27;m participating in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Fantasy&#x2F;comments&#x2F;ft254j&#x2F;official_rfantasy_2020_book_bingo_challenge&#x2F;&quot;&gt;r&#x2F;Fantasy bingo&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; despite being subscribed to this subreddit for about 5 years. The idea is to expand your reading by filling 5-25 squares. Each square has an easy mode and a hard mode with additional restrictions. Since I average more than one book a week, I felt I could easily do one &lt;strong&gt;Hard mode&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; card and perhaps do a few more cards later. In the end, I struggled to finish a single HM card.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also added another self-imposed rule that any author I&#x27;ve already read prior to the start of the bingo cannot be used for this card. That made it tougher to fill the squares. In retrospect, I should&#x27;ve kept this rule but chosen easy mode. I don&#x27;t plan to do HM next time, but perhaps I&#x27;ll keep the tradition of picking a self-imposed rule.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <title>10 favorite fictional books I read in 2020</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I read 97 fictional novels in 2020, including re-reads. Most of them were fantasy, rest would fall under sci-fi and magical realism. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years back, I would finish a book no matter how difficult or boring it was. Not so anymore, I had at least three DNF this year â€” one was too dark for my tastes and the other two were too boring.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picking favorites is a tough task and choosing the order of presentation even more so. I&#x27;ve gone with books I enjoyed the most and these are all great candidates for future re-reads. I am not so good with rating prose, characters, worldbuilding, plot holes, etc anyway.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
