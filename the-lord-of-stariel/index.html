Long live the Lord of Stariel. Whoever that is.<p>Everyone knows who the magical estate will choose for its next ruler. Or do they?<p>Will it be the lordâ€™s eldest son, who he despised?<p>His favourite nephew, with the strongest magical land-sense?<p>His scandalous daughter, who ran away from home years ago to study illusion?<p>But whoever Stariel chooses will have bigger problems than eccentric relatives to deal with.<p>Winged, beautifully deadly problems.<p>For the first time in centuries, the fae are returning to the Mortal Realm, and only the Lord of Stariel can keep the estate safe.<p>In theory.</blockquote><h2 id=review>Review</h2><p>I'm not sure if my strategy of giving a few days break between reading books is paying off or lucky with my selections in the last few months. I've been using the term <em>fast paced</em> often while writing reviews, so much so that I've started to doubt if I'm using it badly.<p>Anyway, I finished this book in less than a day. I had expected to read a chapter or so while taking break from work. I didn't get much work done.<p>The opening chapter was interesting and I made a few obvious guesses right away. While some of them came true, I was glad to see the twists that came later. And this also applied to the characters. Like the overbearing Aunt (a trope I hate), who was indeed unlikeable but there was more to her character.<p>The plot was mostly slice-of-life, which is one of my favorite subgenre these days. The series itself seems to be moving towards larger stakes though. Some of the slice-of-life pay-offs I had been expecting didn't materialize in this book. I'm hoping they'll be in the sequels even if the plot goes big.<p>The mystery portion of the book started about a quarter way in, which was one of the twists I didn't see coming. I did manage to guess the culprit about halfway through, but I think that was fairly obvious. Also, I feel the whodunnit aspect wasn't really that important compared to what the author seems to have planned for the series. Magic plays a role too, including a few cool scenes at the end.<p>Overall, I'd highly recommend the book for those who enjoy well written characters in a fantasy-of-manners setting.

A very feminine read (and I don't mean "for girls"), which will delight readers who appreciate a classic style, beautiful and smart dialogues and an absence of clichÃ©s - or rather the presence of twisted ones!</blockquote><p>From <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3286956725>Olivia Atwater's review on goodreads</a>:<blockquote><p>I deeply enjoyed The Lord of Stariel the first time I read it, and it holds up wonderfully on a second read-through! It's a book with all of my favourite elements: an enjoyable female main character, a bit of magical intrigue, a solid romantic interest, andâ€”most importantlyâ€”faeries.</blockquote><h2 id=bingo>Bingo</h2><p><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ttrev1/official_rfantasy_2022_book_bingo_challenge/>/r/Fantasy/ 2022 bingo categories</a>:<ul><li>Book Club OR Readalong Book<li>Author Uses Initials<li>Self-Published OR Indie Publisher<li>Shapeshifters (HM) <ul><li>doesn't feature prominently in this book though</ul><li>Family Matters (HM)</ul></div><div class=post-footer><div class=post-tags><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/fantasy-of-manners/>#fantasy-of-manners</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/romance/>#romance</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/mystery/>#mystery</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/self-published/>#self-published</a></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><div class=post-nav><p><a class=previous href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/axtara-banking-and-finance/>â€¹ Axtara - Banking and Finance: slice-of-life story of a dragon banker</a><br><p><a class=next href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/shadow-of-a-dead-god/>Shadow of a Dead God: fast paced fantasy mystery â€º</a><br></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><p>ðŸ“° Use <a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/rss.xml>this link</a> for the RSS feed. <br> âœ… Follow me on <a href=https://twitter.com/learn_byexample>Twitter</a>, <a href=https://github.com/learnbyexample>GitHub</a> and <a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/learnbyexample42>Youtube</a> for interesting tech nuggets. <br> ðŸ“§ Subscribe to <a href=https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/learnbyexample-weekly>learnbyexample weekly</a> for programming resources, tips, tools, free ebooks and more (free newsletter, delivered every Friday).<hr color=#e6e6e6></div></article></div></main></div><script src=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/even.js></script>
