Parsons</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Rhys is an Artificer who has always dreamed of owning a Cloudship and sailing out beyond his home spire. An opportunity has dropped into his lap to do just that, but the consequences of his choice might very well be too much for him to deal with. Fantasy with some light litrpg elements as Rhys earns the money he needs to grow the ship. Slice of life elements as Rhys learns the ropes of being a Cloudship captain and they explore the other spires.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>I liked this fantasy setting as well as the concept of an upgradable ship. The main character was a nice guy who just wants to earn some cash and explore the spires. But of course, danger found him often. Apart from the main character, I also liked the small crew who joined him as the plot progressed. They each had their own colored past too, though they weren't explored in detail (for that matter, we don't get much of main character's background too, other than important details relevant to the plot).<p>The writing was easy to follow, but it needed another round of editing. For a large part of the book, I was enjoying the slice-of-life stuff. There were dangers too, as I mentioned earlier, but didn't expect it to be escalated so high at the end.<hr><h2 id=armor-by-c-b-titus><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61625532-armor>Armor</a> by <strong>C.B. Titus</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>I was created as the ultimate dungeon trap. A living suit of armor that devours any adventurer who dons me. My master created me for his entertainment, leading adventurers to ruin. Betraying them at the last moment, just when their glorious victory was on hand. I have been found again by the newest member of a quartet of dungeon crawlers. Poor fool. This time will be no different. Or does it have to be?</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>This was a well written, standalone fantasy epic. I was drawn in by the premise of a suit-of-armor main character. The pacing was good in the first half as the team of adventurers go about their tasks one after the other. Their banter was nice and the events kept moving the plot forward. The second half slowed down a bit as the events escalated towards a more epic scale. Politics, information gathering, working with allies, etc. Although there were progression elements in the second half, I'd describe the book as a classical epic fantasy.<p>What I especially liked was the intricate nature of the plot. Things big and small were brought together by the end of the book. Some of the twists were nicely done. Writing was easy to follow. Worldbuilding was just enough to cover the main plot, but you could sense there was lot more to the world that might be touched upon in possible sequels.<hr><h2 id=shards-of-honor-by-lois-mcmaster-bujold><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/531792.Shards_of_Honor>Shards of Honor</a> by <strong>Lois McMaster Bujold</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>When Cordelia Naismith and her survey crew are attacked by a renegade group from Barrayar, she is taken prisoner by Aral Vorkosigan, commander of the Barrayan ship that has been taken over by an ambitious and ruthless crew member. Aral and Cordelia survive countless mishaps while their mutual admiration and even stronger feelings emerge.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>I'd previously read and enjoyed "The Curse of Chalion". I needed to read a book that's been on my TBR for a long time (for a bingo reading event), so I finally got around to this book. I enjoyed the first half of the book more than the second half. An alien planet with fascinating flora and fauna. The two main characters having to survive a long trip on foot in a dangerous environment, while caring for a heavily injured person. The twists and an almost comical case of misunderstandings in a very serious situation.<p>What followed wasn't as enticing as I expected. Lot more focus on politics, deadly maneuvers and trigger events that almost had me DNFing.<hr><h2 id=master-of-steel-by-aaron-renfroe><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/198550083-master-of-steel>Master of Steel</a> by <strong>Aaron Renfroe</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Harvey killed the World Boss. Now he must clean up the mess.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>The second book in the "Father of Constructs" series was another nice mix of team camaraderie, humor, progression and solving problems as they travel between Oases. Writing was easy to follow and the worldbuilding was great. I especially liked how organic it felt, how old and new magic shaped the culture and challenges. Action was done well and there were a few unexcepted twists too. Lots to look forward.<hr><h2 id=beast-mage-by-derek-alan-siddoway><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61165418-beast-mage>Beast Mage</a> by <strong>Derek Alan Siddoway</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>After his little sister vanishes before his eyes, Kellen awakens in another realm inhabited by mythical creatures and people who shape the very forces of nature. These are the Beastcallers, wielders of elemental magics who ascend alongside their beast companions. In search of his sister, Kellen explores a savage new world full of magical storms, animal demi-gods and warring tribes.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>I was looking for a quick, fun read. The starting few chapters seemed promising, despite being darker than I had hoped for. The pacing was good, which was I why I kept reading. Around half-way point, I started enjoyed the book more, especially the humor of the bonded beast (it was a bit irritating at the beginning). The introduction of a character near the end made the best impression for me. The worldbuilding was nice in patches, especially things like mana storm, bison stampede, the various clans, etc.<p>I didn't enjoy the sequel as much as the first one.<hr><h2 id=the-stardust-thief-by-chelsea-abdullah><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58950705-the-stardust-thief>The Stardust Thief</a> by <strong>Chelsea Abdullah</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Loulie al-Nazari is the Midnight Merchant: a criminal who, with the help of her jinn bodyguard, hunts and sells illegal magic. When she saves the life of a cowardly prince, she draws the attention of his powerful father, the sultan, who blackmails her into finding an ancient lamp that has the power to revive the barren land—at the cost of sacrificing all jinn.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>The starting few chapters were great, especially the worldbuilding and characters that might prove to be interesting. However, around the time the quest was forced upon the party, I was losing interest. Too much of emotional drama, betrayals and deaths. I liked the concept of magic/relics/etc and loved some of the storytelling scenes, but overall it was a chore to finish the book.<hr><h2 id=the-outlaws-of-sherwood-by-robin-mckinley><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41423.The_Outlaws_of_Sherwood>The Outlaws of Sherwood</a> by <strong>Robin McKinley</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Robin McKinley's vivid retelling of the classic story of Robin Hood breathes contemporary life into these beloved adventures, with Marian taking a pivotal role as one of Robin's best archers.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>Been a long long time since I read a Robin Hood book (got it as a prize in school). One retelling I read some months back wasn't close to what I vaguely remembered about the book I reread multiple times as a kid. The first meeting between Robin and John in "The Outlaws of Sherwood" was one of the scenes I still had good impression of — particularly that it was a staff fight and someone fell in the river.<p>Overall, this book was an enjoyable read. I especially liked Robin wasn't the main focus — many of the merry men got their own scene/story to shine. The ending felt a bit weird though.<hr><h2 id=magical-fusion-by-jonathan-brooks><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/176609632-the-fusionist>Magical Fusion</a> by <strong>Jonathan Brooks</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>A young man and his axe, along with a magical life he never asked for…Larek Holsten is different from most people, living in the Kingdom of Androthe where his 7-foot-tall frame is looked at with suspicion and anger from its shorter residents; but as long as it helps him become the best Logger he can be, he doesn’t let it bother him all that much. Unfortunately, after visiting the local village, a deliberate misunderstanding lands Larek in trouble; as a result, he is taken away from his family and the only home he has ever known.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>The starting few chapters were light on details about the magic, focusing on setting up a few things for events to come, etc. The writing was easy to follow and pacing was good, so it felt as if the starting of the main plot came too soon. When things took a much darker turn before I could even get a good feel for the setting, I almost dropped the book. Fortunately, I kept reading and the magical academy chapters that followed were awesome, especially the crafting parts. However, I wasn't a fan of the overall plot, had many minor complaints and would've preferred if some of the nicer side-characters had been given more scenes to shine on their own.<p>I enjoyed the two sequels better than the first one. A few POV scenes from side-characters were a welcome addition. It was fascinating to see details of the overarching plot being revealed at various occasions, and it cleared some of the confusion I had in the first book. And I especially liked that the main character got some much needed support from competent characters. I even enjoyed the political maneuvering, which I'm usually not a fan of. Overall I'm enjoying the series despite the dark setting and author's penchant for killing off interesting side-characters.</div><div class=post-footer><div class=post-tags><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/2023/>#2023</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/mini-reviews/>#mini-reviews</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/fantasy/>#fantasy</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/progression/>#progression</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/epic/>#epic</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/dark/>#dark</a></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><div class=post-nav><p><a class=previous href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/dear-spellbook/>‹ Dear Spellbook: engaging time-loop progression fantasy</a><br><p><a class=next href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/the-pale-blade/>The Pale Blade: engaging epic fantasy set in a wondrous world ›</a><br></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><p>📰 Use <a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/rss.xml>this link</a> for the RSS feed. <br> ✅ Follow me on <a href=https://twitter.com/learn_byexample>Twitter</a>, <a href=https://github.com/learnbyexample>GitHub</a> and <a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/learnbyexample42>Youtube</a> for interesting tech nuggets. <br> 📧 Subscribe to <a href=https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/learnbyexample-weekly>learnbyexample weekly</a> for programming resources, tips, tools, free ebooks and more (free newsletter, delivered every Friday).<hr color=#e6e6e6></div></article></div></main></div><script src=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/even.js></script>
