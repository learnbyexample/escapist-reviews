The idea is to expand your reading by filling 5-25 squares. Each square has an easy mode and a hard mode with additional restrictions. Since I average more than one book a week, I felt I could easily do one <strong>Hard mode</strong> card and perhaps do a few more cards later. In the end, I struggled to finish a single HM card.<p>I also added another self-imposed rule that any author I've already read prior to the start of the bingo cannot be used for this card. That made it tougher to fill the squares. In retrospect, I should've kept this rule but chosen easy mode. I don't plan to do HM next time, but perhaps I'll keep the tradition of picking a self-imposed rule.</p><span id=continue-reading></span><hr><h2 id=first-row>First row</h2><h3 id=1-novel-translated-from-its-original-language>1. Novel Translated from its Original Language</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1110224.Dragon_Sword_and_Wind_Child>Dragon Sword and Wind Child</a> by Noriko Ogiwara, Cathy Hirano (Translator)<p>I picked up this book as a break from my usual comfort reads. I've seen a few anime/movies and read east Asian inspired books before, but this was quite different from them. Overall, I liked the book, probably because I wasn't expecting things to be similar to what I'm used to. In fact, things did seem familiar at the start, but then events kept changing from the well worn path that you are better off avoiding any prediction. I'd recommend this for its strengths - mythology, setting and interesting characters.<hr><h3 id=2-setting-featuring-snow-ice-or-cold>2. Setting Featuring Snow, Ice, or Cold</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28117720-heart-of-ice>Heart of Ice</a> by K.M. Shea<p>I enjoyed this more than what I expected from the blurb. Special points for the writing, which was a little unique in the way of description, dialogues, etc that I found it refreshing. The pacing was good, kept me turning pages. The characters were nicely done as well. If I had to find something to complain, I'd say that the enemy didn't adapt much despite the prior encounters.<hr><h3 id=3-optimistic-sff>3. Optimistic SFF</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33916024-sourdough>Sourdough</a> by Robin Sloan<p>I enjoyed this a lot, especially the slice-of- <del>bread</del> life aspects. I didn't expect the climax to have such a big explosion, but it did help end the novel nicely. I'll be checking out other books from the author for sure. Hope they are as good as Sourdough, especially interesting characters.<hr><h3 id=4-novel-featuring-necromancy>4. Novel Featuring Necromancy</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45822382-mid-lich-crisis>Mid-Lich Crisis</a> by Steve Thomas<p>Humor can be hit/miss with me. This was mostly a hit even though I didn't get all the cultural references. The ending left me a bit confused and in a bad taste. Mulling it over afterwards, I felt like may be things will be clarified in sequels or perhaps I didn't fully understand the ending. Either way, I'll still recommend this book.<hr><h3 id=5-ace-aro-spec-fic>5. Ace / Aro Spec Fic</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39979131-baker-thief>Baker Thief</a> by Claudie Arseneault<p>Mostly liked the book, especially the slice-of-life parts. But the main plot is quite dark in its content. I think I'd have liked it better if the slice-of-life parts were more prominent and the plot was something simpler, or a small scale investigation instead of evil corporations exploiting people.<hr><h2 id=second-row>Second row</h2><h3 id=6-novel-featuring-a-ghost>6. Novel Featuring a Ghost</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16248223-the-ghost-bride>The Ghost Bride</a> by Yangsze Choo<p>I liked the afterworld setting, some characters (ex: medium) and some of the ghosts that Li Lan meets. Prose was good and some of the historical nuggets were interesting. But not much else, especially hated the family politics.<hr><h3 id=7-novel-featuring-exploration>7. Novel Featuring Exploration</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32109569-we-are-legion-we-are-bob>We Are Legion (We Are Bob)</a> by Dennis E. Taylor<p>Enjoyed it. I liked that the tone was light hearted, which allowed me to enjoy the exploration stuff instead of fuming at all the politics and maniacs intent on destruction. It was a bit difficult to get invested with the characters/setting in the first half, but enjoyed the rest of the book.<hr><h3 id=8-climate-fiction>8. Climate Fiction</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/285746.The_Anvil_of_Ice>The Anvil of Ice</a> by Michael Scott Rohan<p>I liked the plot in the first half of the novel. Magical smithing was the best portion that I liked. Fights were realistic. But I found the prose difficult to understand and wasn't a fan of second half of the novel.<hr><h3 id=9-novel-with-a-colour-in-the-title>9. Novel with a Colour in the Title</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53397483-river-of-fate>River of Fate: The Jade Scripture</a> by David North<p>I enjoyed this cultivation novel for the most part. It has most of the familiar tropes - getting stronger, MC is special through some quirk of fate, fights, sects/schools, buying and selling things related to weapons/cultivation, etc. The MC here doesn't hesitate to take decisive action for the most part, which I liked too.<p>The magic system is well thought out and divided into stages, with 10 advancements per stage. However, the details were a bit too much and I didn't try too hard to understand and remember them. There's an appendix chapter as well with details for those interested in that sort of stuff. The overly detailed description extended to MC's thinking and his experiences too. About halfway, I just started skimming such details.<p>The other major complaint for me was support characters and lack of lighter moments. There are other POVs and a few characters who do get some character development. But, the majority of the book is about the MC, his past, training, etc. There are hints that it can change in the next book and I hope that is the case.<hr><h3 id=10-any-r-fantasy-book-club-book-of-the-month-or-r-fantasy-read-along-book>10.

But, I didn't fully enjoy reading the book. I'm typically looking for easy to read, fast paced novels as a means for escapism.<p><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/hqcxzb/gr_book_of_the_month_the_starless_sea_by_erin/><em>Book club discussion part 1</em></a>, <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/hyserx/gr_book_of_the_month_the_starless_sea_by_erin/><em>discussion part 2</em></a><hr><h2 id=third-row>Third row</h2><h3 id=11-self-published-sff-novel>11.

Even the setting felt like 19th century. It sets a high bar of expectation. While the author does a good job of showing off Martin's detective skills, I would have enjoyed a less Sherlocky character.<p>That said, the world building was good and there are hints about more to come. The pacing was good at the start of the book, slowed a bit and then picked up again towards the end. Characters were well developed too (wish the housekeeper had been given some POV scenes).<hr><h3 id=12-novel-with-chapter-epigraphs>12. Novel with Chapter Epigraphs</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48498701-queens-of-the-wyrd>Queens of the Wyrd</a> by Timandra Whitecastle<p>This was very well written, especially the characters. It was easy to read and pacing was good enough to keep going. The ending was nice as well. Having a kid among the team really worked for the story being told. However, the world lore got confusing with so many names, with some of them having multiple monikers. But I suppose if you are already familiar with Norse mythology, you might find it easier to understand and interesting as well.<hr><h3 id=13-novel-published-in-2020>13. Novel Published in 2020</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53486007-cradle-of-sea-and-soil>Cradle of Sea and Soil</a> by Bernie Anés Paz<p>This was a darker read than I expected. The main focus is the mother-son duo (which reminded me a bit of The Sword of Kaigen). I liked their relationship, as well as Narune's two friends and the Sage who comes to help them often.<p>I'm quite bored of the eternal fight between creation and destruction (termed as stillness in this book) trope though. The spiritseer magic was quite interesting, but it was too difficult to understand and wasn't the focus of the novel. I'd have loved if there were POV among the other spiritseers and their training, relationships, etc. Too much talk about the stillness and the sense of dread they create lessens the enjoyment/escapism I wish to get from reading fantasy.<hr><h3 id=14-novel-set-in-a-school-or-university>14. Novel Set in a School or University</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27790093-the-combat-codes>The Combat Codes</a> by Alexander Darwin<p>Overall, I liked the book and will read the sequel sometime later. Usually, I like lot of magical use, but the author does a nice job of incorporating fantasy-like (specifically progression fantasy) set up with physical combat skills. The pacing picked up about a quarter of a way into the book. The tone is serious for most of the book, so the few lighter moments stood out (wish there were lot more).<p>Character wise, there are two main POVs and I felt both characters were nicely done. I'd say secondary characters were also decently written, but lacked polish. Some scenes at the end felt abrupt to me (a character observes something, but that line of thought isn't followed up, an intense emotional scene is building up and then cuts off, etc) I would've liked more interaction, instead it is left to readers to fill the gaps.<hr><h3 id=15-sub-a-sff-novel-featuring-a-character-with-a-disability>15. (Sub) A SFF Novel Featuring a Character With a Disability</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52844260-catching-cinders>Catching Cinders</a> by Kendra Merritt<p>I enjoyed this romance novel despite being a bit skeptical if I'll like yet another Cindrella story. I'd say the novel stands on its own - magic and politics blended nicely with a love story. The lead characters were both likeable, and the side characters were good too. The prose was easy to follow. I hope I can check out the other novels set in this world soon.<hr><h2 id=fourth-row>Fourth row</h2><h3 id=16-a-book-that-made-you-laugh>16. A Book that Made You Laugh</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53310083-a-new-beginning>A New Beginning</a> by J.E. Thompson<p>Humor can be hit/miss with me, and I usually don't like the kind used often in this book, but they got a laugh out of me. The book is fast paced action, with one quest following right after the previous one finished, sometimes multiple quests on the same day. I'd have loved a bit more world building, character growth, etc but I don't think the author intends to go in that direction. Just a fast paced fun to read novel, ideal as a palate cleanser between epic fantasies.<hr><h3 id=17-five-sff-short-stories>17. Five SFF Short Stories</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41160292-exhalation>Exhalation: Stories</a> by Ted Chiang<p>Well written sci-fi short story collection. But, leaned too much towards philosophical and existential questions for my liking. I didn't know about what kind of stories to expect, I'd probably have not read the collection otherwise. Good to have read these thought provoking stories, but I'm not one to search out such books to read.<hr><h3 id=18-big-dumb-object>18. Big Dumb Object</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/95558.Solaris>Solaris</a> by Stanisław Lem<p>The premise was nice and some of the mysteries too. But overall, the book was difficult to understand for me, especially the long winded scientific chapters and internal monologues.<hr><h3 id=19-feminist-novel>19. Feminist Novel</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52397.Parable_of_the_Sower>Parable of the Sower</a> by Octavia E. Butler<p>Writing is clear and easy to follow, but the setting is horror filled and too depressing to read. I liked whenever things were hopeful, people with different ideologies coming together, a sense of acceptance, etc.<hr><h3 id=20-novel-by-a-canadian-author>20. Novel by a Canadian Author</h3><p><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52654173-half-a-soul>Half a Soul</a> by Olivia Atwater<p>What a lovely book. Finished it in a day. Characters, setting, plot, pacing - all of them combined well to make me turn pages in a hurry. The prologue didn't catch my attention much, but the first two chapters quickly grabbed my interest. I wish it was a longer tale and included more POVs.<hr><h2 id=fifth-row>Fifth row</h2><h3 id=21-novel-with-a-number-in-the-title>21.

After a bit of struggle, I liked this book for the most part. The actual adventure stuff was good. I'd have liked if the rest of the time had some interesting events <em>shown</em> instead of just being <em>told</em> all the time. Some actual learning moments would have made the book so much better.<hr><h3 id=22-romantic-fantasy-paranormal-romance>22.

I would have definitely preferred a full length novel, but perhaps some stories can be told in 70 odd pages and still leave a lasting impression. Reminded me a bit of Becky Chambers.<p><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/j1zw0i/hea_book_club_the_cybernetic_tea_shop_final/><em>HEA book club discussion</em></a><hr><h3 id=23-novel-with-a-magical-pet>23.

After reading the book, I wish it were set in an imaginary world, without real world politics, so that I could enjoy it more and put it on the re-read shelf. I might still read the sequel someday. The magic system was awesome.
