A suspicious traveler in gray, a gnome with a chip on her shoulder, a summer fling, and an improbable number of skeletons prove Murk to be more eventful than Viv could have ever expected.</blockquote><h2 id=review><p style="color: #7e0b5f">Review</h2><p>As preparation, I reread "Legends & Lattes" (plus the <a href=https://travisbaldree.com/pages-to-fill>"Pages to Fill"</a> short-story, which got added after the original self-pub version). Honestly, I enjoyed this reread more than "Bookshops & Bonedust". And I'm struggling to reason out why. There was a charming plot of reviving an old bookshop, with characters as good as L&L (the book cover doesn't feature the best of them though!). Plenty of baked goodness. There's magic, mystery and action. The best reason I could come up is the descriptions and philosophical musings. Too many of them derailed the pacing â€” I wasn't itching to read the book in one sitting like L&L.<p>That said, I feel most people who enjoyed L&L would like this one too. Viv is younger and brash, but that just adds to the charm and her kinder nature is still present. We get to see how Viv met one of her adventure team member as well as an item that I didn't expect (was a pleasant surprise for me, and I correctly predicted how she'd use it).<p>I especially liked the tidbits about bookshops and authors. Made me wish I could get the chance of recommending books IRL again (my friends are all too busy with work and married life).<p>The tiny illustrations at the start of the chapters were nicely done. The epilogue got my hopes high that we'd see a L&L sequel :)<p><em>My rating:</em> ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸâ˜†<h3 id=what-others-are-saying><p style="color: #a0494c">What others are saying</h3><p>From <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5745695287>Bethany's review on goodreads</a>:<blockquote><p>While perhaps nothing will quite match the magic of Legends & Lattes, I really enjoyed this and hope we get more stories in this world! I love the idea of these quieter tales found in-between the adventures.</blockquote><p>From <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5183463720>Veronique's review on goodreads</a>:<blockquote><p>I will admit that it took me a little longer to become invested in the narrative, but once I was, I enjoyed it. I mean we all love books here, and therefore bookshops :O) The cast was again a disparate group that you couldn't help but come to like. In all, a lovely comfy read for those days when you need to snuggle.</blockquote></div><div class=post-footer><div class=post-tags><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/fantasy/>#fantasy</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/slice-of-life/>#slice-of-life</a></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><div class=post-nav><p><a class=previous href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/the-engineer/>â€¹ The Engineer: a nice mix of space action, humor and intrigue</a><br><p><a class=next href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/sanctuary/>Sanctuary: entertaining mix of slice-of-life and action â€º</a><br></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><p>ðŸ“° Use <a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/rss.xml>this link</a> for the RSS feed. <br> âœ… Follow me on <a href=https://twitter.com/learn_byexample>Twitter</a>, <a href=https://github.com/learnbyexample>GitHub</a> and <a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/learnbyexample42>Youtube</a> for interesting tech nuggets. <br> ðŸ“§ Subscribe to <a href=https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/learnbyexample-weekly>learnbyexample weekly</a> for programming resources, tips, tools, free ebooks and more (free newsletter, delivered every Friday).<hr color=#e6e6e6></div></article></div></main></div><script src=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/even.js></script>
