I rated all these six books with 4 stars (out of 5). Give them a shot if they sound interesting.<p>The links lead to the book page on goodreads, from where I've also copied a portion of the blurbs for this post.</p><span id=continue-reading></span><hr><h2 id=stranger-back-home-by-e-l-haines><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57950046-stranger-back-home>Stranger Back Home</a> by <strong>E.L. Haines</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>When Sparrow is summoned to the reading of his father's last will and testament, the most he hoped for was a minor bequest. Instead, he inherited suspicion and accusations from the Empire that his father helped unite.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>I liked the plot, but the humor was more miss than hit for me.<p>It was well written. Plenty of slice-of-life scenes (especially at the start) which I liked. The pacing was also good - steady for the first half and faster as the main plot came into focus.<hr><h2 id=skate-the-thief-by-jeff-ayers><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52773232-skate-the-thief>Skate the Thief</a> by <strong>Jeff Ayers</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Skate is a thief, trained and owned by the local crime syndicate, the Ink. When she tries to burgle a shut-in’s home, she gets caught by the owner—a powerful undead wizard. He makes a deal with her: “borrow” books from other wizards in return for a place to stay.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>A light-hearted (mostly) tale of a thief caught and sheltered by a wizard. Plenty of slice-of-life events to savor, peppered with a handful of fast-paced action scenes to move the plot along.<hr><h2 id=the-tower-unbroken-by-michael-nwanolue><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59653476-the-tower-unbroken>The Tower Unbroken</a> by <strong>Michael Nwanolue</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>For as long as he can remember, Somadina has wanted to be a dibia – A cultivator of magic and power. But being the last surviving member of a tribe with a sick mother to boot has since made such dreams impossible. Up until he stumbles upon the cave that changes everything.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>This was a promising start to a new progression fantasy series. The writing was easy to follow and the main characters and companions were all interesting, with their own quirks.<p>The magic system would be mostly familiar for those who've read some cultivation novels. I'd say the author did a good job of integrating the world building with the magic system, it felt natural.<p>The pacing was good right from the first chapter. I'd say the progression was much faster though - it was like 4-5 books compressed to a 300-page book. Given the multiverse setting, I suppose it was an intentional decision by the author.<hr><h2 id=ella-enchanted-by-gail-carson-levine><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24337.Ella_Enchanted>Ella Enchanted</a> by <strong>Gail Carson Levine</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>At birth, Ella is inadvertently cursed by an imprudent young fairy named Lucinda, who bestows on her the "gift" of obedience. Anything anyone tells her to do, Ella must obey. Another girl might have been cowed by this affliction, but not feisty Ella: "Instead of making me docile, Lucinda's curse made a rebel of me. Or perhaps I was that way naturally."</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>A nice whimsical fantasy, with plenty of goofy moments.<p>I was drawn in by the premise and I liked the various events/situation around the <em>gift</em>.<p>The pacing and world building was good as well.<hr><h2 id=concealed-by-vanessa-nelson><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40691307-concealed>Concealed</a> by <strong>Vanessa Nelson</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>Oath-bound to the arrogant Erith in exchange for her life, Arrow's freedom is days away when they set her one last task; investigate the death of a high-ranking shape-changer, one of their old enemies.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>I liked the main character, magic system and the mixed fantasy/modern setting.<p>The pacing was good right from the first chapter, with world building details doled out as needed in every chapter.<p>I couldn't stand the constant discrimination though, so I don't think I'll read the rest of the series.<hr><h2 id=shadow-of-the-fox-by-julie-kagawa><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36672988-shadow-of-the-fox>Shadow of the Fox</a> by <strong>Julie Kagawa</strong></h2><p><strong>Blurb</strong><blockquote><p>One thousand years ago, the great Kami Dragon was summoned to grant a single terrible wish—and the land of Iwagoto was plunged into an age of darkness and chaos. Now, for whoever holds the Scroll of a Thousand Prayers, a new wish will be granted. A new age is about to dawn.</blockquote><p><strong>Review</strong><p>I found this a fast paced read (helped by skimming world building descriptions - they were well written, I just wasn't in the mood to enjoy them).<p>I enjoyed the contrast of characteristics between the lead pair. The comedy relief provided by a side character was a pleasant surprise.<p>I loved the side quests more than the main conflict at the end.<p>In fact, the consequences of the first book ending made it difficult for me to enjoy the sequel and had to DNF. More of a not-for-me than anything else.</div><div class=post-footer><div class=post-tags><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/2021/>#2021</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/mini-reviews/>#mini-reviews</a><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/tags/fantasy/>#fantasy</a></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><div class=post-nav><p><a class=previous href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/weirkey-chronicles/>‹ The Weirkey Chronicles: enjoyable fast paced progression fantasy</a><br><p><a class=next href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/bastion/>Bastion: fast paced epic progression fantasy ›</a><br></div><hr color=#e6e6e6><p>📰 Use <a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/rss.xml>this link</a> for the RSS feed. <br> ✅ Follow me on <a href=https://twitter.com/learn_byexample>Twitter</a>, <a href=https://github.com/learnbyexample>GitHub</a> and <a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/learnbyexample42>Youtube</a> for interesting tech nuggets. <br> 📧 Subscribe to <a href=https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/learnbyexample-weekly>learnbyexample weekly</a> for programming resources, tips, tools, free ebooks and more (free newsletter, delivered every Friday).<hr color=#e6e6e6></div></article></div></main></div><script src=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/even.js></script>
